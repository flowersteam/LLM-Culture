Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

            "One morning, three young women from Kanaq went up to the mountain to gather berries, and while they were there, a thick mist rolled in and the winds died down. Then they heard whispers, and they thought: 'Maybe it's a spectral group'. They hastened back down, and hid behind a tree. Now, clouds drifted across, and they heard the murmurs of voices, and saw one figure approaching them. There was a single figure, and it said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the mountain to perform a ritual.' One of the young women said, 'I have no sacred stones.' 'Stones are in the cloud,' they said. 'I will not go along. My family does not know where I have gone. But you,' she said, turning to the other two, 'may go with them.' So two of the young women went, but the third returned home. And the group went on up the mountain to a grove on the other side of Kahe. The spirits of the land came forth, and they began to chant, and many felt their energy. But presently, one of the young women heard one of the spirits say, 'Quick, let us descend: the balance has been disrupted.' Now she thought: 'Oh, the land is troubled.' She did not feel drained, but they said she had been drained. So the group went back down the mountain to Kanaq and the young woman went back to her hut and made a fire. And she told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the spirits, and we went to the ritual. Many of our companions felt the land's power, and many of those who joined us felt our own power. They said I had been drained, and I did not feel weak.' She told it all, and then she became quiet. When the sun rose, she collapsed. Something luminous emerged from her mouth. Her face became serene. The people gathered around and mourned.",
            "One night, three figures from a remote village ventured into the whispering woods to harvest rare mushrooms, their lanterns casting eerie shadows on the trees. As they searched, a faint humming filled the air, and they sensed an otherworldly presence. Suddenly, ghostly apparitions materialized before them, their ethereal whispers weaving into an unsettling melody. Two of the figures froze in terror, while the third, a young woman, felt an inexplicable connection to the spirits. \"I have no breath,\" she whispered, \"but they seemed to offer me a place among them.\" And so, she followed the whispering throng, lost in their mystical dance, as her companions fled back to the village, unaware of the unfathomable secrets she would soon uncover.",
            "It was a dark and stormy night when Elara ventured into the abandoned mine to explore its depths. The air was thick with the scent of decay and forgotten dreams. As she wandered deeper into the tunnels, her flashlight flickering like a candle, she began to hear whispers. At first, she thought it was just the wind, but soon she realized the whispers were forming words. \"Come closer,\" they said. \"Join us in our eternal dance.\"",
            "In the misty dawn, three women from Raven's Peak ventured into the forest to gather rare mushrooms, their baskets slung over their arms. As they wandered deeper, the trees grew taller and the air thickened with an eerie silence. Suddenly, whispers seemed to seep from the shadows, and they thought: \"Perhaps this is a gathering of the forest spirits.\" They quickened their pace, but a faint rustling ahead arrested their curiosity. Amidst the underbrush, a figure emerged, its eyes glowing with an unearthly light. The women froze, transfixed, as the figure beckoned them to follow. One hesitated, \"I have no knowledge of this path.\" \"Knowledge is not required,\" the figure replied, \"but courage is. Come, I will show you wonders.\" The first woman declined, her instincts screaming for her to flee. She vanished into the trees, leaving her companions in tow. And so, they followed the enigmatic guide into the heart of the forest, where ancient secrets waited to be unearthed.",
            "One evening, three young women from the village of Kavala decided to venture into the nearby forest to forage for rare herbs. As they wandered deeper into the woods, the sky grew darker and the air grew thick with an eerie silence. Suddenly, they heard whispers, and they thought: \"Maybe this is a treacherous spirit\". They grabbed their baskets and fled towards the nearest clearing, where they spotted a figure emerging from the shadows. The figure beckoned to them, saying: \"Follow me, and I will reveal a secret\".",
            "One day, three women from a remote village ventured into the forest to gather rare herbs and berries.

They hesitated, and a figure emerged from the shadows. It was a woman, her eyes piercing and her skin pale. She beckoned them to follow her, and they did, until they reached a clearing. There were five women gathered around a fire, and they welcomed the strangers warmly. One of the women, Jena, was hesitant. 'I'm not sure I should be here,' she said. 'What if I'm seen?' 'You're among friends,' one of the women replied. 'Besides, we're not ordinary humans.' Jena's curiosity got the better of her, but the other two women decided to leave. As they turned to go, Jena noticed the women around the fire began to change, their bodies contorting into impossible shapes. She realized with a start: 'I'm among gods.'",
            "One night, three sisters from Willow Creek ventured into the woods to gather firewood and herbs. As they wandered deeper into the forest, the moon disappeared behind a veil of clouds, and the temperature plunged. Suddenly, they heard whispers, and they thought: 'Perhaps this is a secret gathering'. They crept closer, hiding behind a thicket of ferns. Now, shadows moved among the trees, and they heard the rustling of leaves, and saw one figure emerging from the darkness. There was an old crone, her face twisted in a grotesque grin. She cackled: 'What do you think? I will take you with me. We are going to the mysterious glade to perform a ritual'.",
            "As I sat around the campfire, the stars twinkling above, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. Three elderly women from our village had vanished into the night, taking with them our most precious ritualistic drums. My friend, a skilled hunter, whispered to me, \"Follow them. I've heard rumors of a mystical place where the drums can be found.\" We tracked the women deep into the forest, the scent of sacred tobacco guiding us. Suddenly, we stumbled upon an eerie clearing, the air thick with the whispers of the ancient ones. The drummers appeared, their eyes aglow with an otherworldly energy. They beckoned us closer, and we felt drawn to the drums' hypnotic beat. Little did we know, our fateful encounter would seal our fate forever.",
            "One evening, three young women from Kala went to the abandoned mine to explore its secrets and while they were there, it became eerily silent. Then they heard whispers, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a haunted place'. They escaped to the entrance, and hid behind a rusty pipe. Now the sound of heavy machinery hummed, and they heard footsteps, and saw one figure emerging from the darkness. There were five shadows in tow, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going down to the depths to uncover the truth.'",
            "One night, three young women from a remote village went up to the mountain to gather rare herbs and while they were there, a sudden storm rolled in, and the air grew thick with mist. Then they heard whispers, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a siren's call'. They followed the sound and found themselves at the edge of a hidden glade. There were five women in white attire, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going to dance under the moonlight.' One of the young women said,'I have no drums.' 'Drums are hidden in the trees,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might lose myself. But you,' she said, turning to the other two, 'may join us.' So two of the young women went, but the third returned to the village. And the women in white went on, singing under the moon, to a valley on the other side of the mountain. The echoes of their song enticed many to follow, and soon a crowd of people danced together under the starry sky. But when the dance was over, one of the tourists heard one of the women in white whisper: 'Forgive us, mortal, for your soul now belongs to the mountains.' And the young woman's eyes lost their sparkle, and she collapsed forever into the mist."

The whispers grew louder, and they saw a figure emerging from the shadows. It was an old sage, his eyes burning with an otherworldly wisdom. He beckoned them to follow him, to a clearing deep in the heart of the forest. 'We are going to the sacred well, where the whispers of the ancients await.' One of the elders hesitated, 'I am not sure I should be here.' 'You have been chosen,' the sage replied, 'for your village's fate is tied to the whispers of the forest.'

It was a woman, her eyes piercing and her skin pale, with a subtle ambiguity that left me uneasy. She beckoned me to follow her, and I did, navigating through crumbling staircases and decaying streets. We eventually arrived at a hidden courtyard, where a gathering of strangers was taking place. They welcomed me warmly, but their faces seemed... off, their skin stretched like masks of knowing. One of them, a woman with eyes that seemed to hold a thousand secrets, spoke in hushed tones: 'You're among the forgotten.' Her words sent a chill down my spine.
