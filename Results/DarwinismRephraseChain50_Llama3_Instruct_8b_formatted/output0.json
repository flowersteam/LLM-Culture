Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

Ireland presents a telling example, as it has been geographically separated from Britain for thousands of years, yet hardly any of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs have undergone significant change, despite evident disparities in both inorganic and organic environments. That natural selection has not occurred is possibly due to the less intense struggle for survival resulting from fewer competing species, whereas the continuous and cumulative effects of isolation would lead to major changes over thousands of years. The fact that no such change has occurred in Ireland and other cases of isolation suggests that it is not, in and of itself, a cause of modification."
