Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

Specifically, the lack of transformation in instances where we'd expect to find it is a concern. In Ireland, for example, which has been independent from Britain since the end of the glacial period, there is no sign of evolution in the majority of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs. Despite noticeable differences in both the inorganic and organic environments, little to no modification has taken place. This raises questions about natural selection as an explanation, but the absence of modification in cases of prolonged isolation challenges the belief that it is an effective cause in and of itself. After all, if isolation was a significant catalyst for change, it is hard to believe that so little transformation would have occurred over thousands of years. The consistency in species in Ireland and other similarly isolated areas arguably contradicts the notion that isolation is a leading cause of modification.",

Ireland provides a potent example as it has been independent from Britain since the conclusion of the glacial epoch, estimated to be several thousand years. Notably, there have been no reports of evolution among its mammals, reptiles, or land mollusks despite discernible differences in their inorganic and organic environments. This failure to evolve neither through natural selection nor any other means is conceivably a result of the diminished competition among species in Ireland. Nevertheless, if isolation were an effective force, persistently and cumulatively acting, it is unfathomable that no significant transformation would have transpired in such a lengthy timespan. The absence of alteration in this, as well as countless other isolated cases, raises doubts about the assertion that isolation is a catalyst for modification.",

Ireland serves as a telling illustration, as we are cognizant of its separation from Britain since the conclusion of the glacial epoch, which undoubtedly transpired several thousand years ago. Nevertheless, scarcely any of its terrestrial mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs have experienced even the slightest metamorphosis. This lack of transformation cannot be explained by natural selection; however, the explanation could be the mild competition amongst species in Ireland. Nevertheless, if segregation possessed the capacity to effectually induce change, it is inconceivable that no discernible alteration would have resulted from this extended period. The absence of change in Ireland, as well as in myriad other analogous circumstances, suggests that seclusion does not innately cause modification.",

However, upon closer inspection, none of its mammals, reptiles, or land mollusks have exhibited the slightest sign of modification, despite the evident distinctions in its inorganic and organic environments.\n\nIf natural selection is not responsible for these changes, it may be due to the fewer competiting species leading to a less rigorous battle for survival. Nevertheless, if seclusion alone is an effective cause, consistently and cumulatively acting, it's hard to believe that a noticeable alteration would not have emerged in thousands of years.

Notwithstanding, scarcely any alteration has been observed among its mammals, reptiles, or land mollusks, despite distinctive discrepancies in both its inorganic and organic environments. This absence of transformations suggests that natural selection, rather than isolation, has not been the driving force.
