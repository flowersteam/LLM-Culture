Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

A pertinent example can be found in Ireland's historical separation from Britain, which dates back to the end of the glacial period. Despite this lengthy isolation, few of its mammals, reptiles, and land mollusks have exhibited any discernible evolution, notwithstanding obvious environmental discrepancies.\n\nThe absence of changes attributed to natural selection might be attributed to fewer competing species resulting in a less rigorous struggle for existence. However, if isolation itself instigates modification, it is unlikely that no alteration would have ensued over thousands of years. The absence of such changes in Ireland, as well as other isolate cases, implies that isolation may not be an inherent catalyst for species evolution.",

Specifically, the lack of transformations in situations where such occurrences would be anticipated based on this theory is noteworthy.\n\nIreland presents an illuminating example, given that it has been disconnected from Britain since the glacial period, a timeframe surpassing numerous thousands of years. In spite of this protracted division, the vast majority of its mammals, reptiles, and terrestrial mollusks show no signs of alteration, despite appreciable differences in both the inorganic and organic surroundings.\n\nWhile it may be explained that natural selection processes have not initiated changes due to the reduced competition amongst species, the absence of modifications following prolonged isolation raises doubts about this theory's efficacy. In numerous cases where such isolation has been observed, the failure to detect any significant transformations implies that it cannot independently trigger modifications.",
            "The argument against the hypothesis that seclusion, as held by Mr. Gulick, instigates species modification merits consideration, specifically the lack of transformation observed in areas where we would predict it to occur. In Ireland, we possess an outstanding example, for we are aware that it has been divorced from Britain since the conclusion of the glacial period, an undoubtedly long duration. Nonetheless, scarcely one of its mammals, reptiles, or land mollusks has detected the slightest alteration, despite noticeable differences in the surrounding inorganic and organic environments.\n\nThat the alterations did not transpire as a result of natural selection can possibly be attributed to the lessened intensity of competition among species in this region. However, if seclusion itself was an operative force, it is incredulous that a notable alteration would not have emerged in thousands of years. The lack of transformation in this, as well as in numerous other instances of seclusion, appears to corroborate the belief that it is not an intrinsic trigger for modification.",

An illuminating example exists in Ireland, as we recognize its separation from Britain following the final ice age, quite possibly exceeding ten thousand years. However, scarcely any mammals, reptiles, or terrestrial mollusks of Ireland have undergone appreciable modification, despite discernible variations in their environments, inorganic and organic.\n\nThat no modification has taken place via natural selection might be attributable to the less strenuous competition for existence brought about by a fewer number of adversarial species. Nevertheless, if seclusion's efficient cause was continuous and additive, it is astonishing that noteworthy alterations didn't emerge over thousands of years. The absence of substantial change in Ireland, among other secluded areas, suggests that it may not instigate modification on its own.",

Despite this lengthy separation, few, if any, instances of modification are apparent among its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs, despite observable differences in both inorganic and organic environments. The absence of change through natural selection may be accounted for by the reduced competition among species; however, if isolation were an effective cause, acting steadily and cumulatively, it is hard to believe that no noticeable change would have emerged over thousands of years. The failure to observe evolutionary transformations in this and other cases of isolation casts doubt upon the notion that it is inherently a driving force for modification."
