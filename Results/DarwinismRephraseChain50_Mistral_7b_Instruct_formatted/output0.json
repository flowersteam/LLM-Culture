Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

            "The notion that evolution advances more swiftly in sealed environments is intriguing but poses significant inquiries. For example, what accounts for the absence of significant evolutionary transformations in confined habitats?\n\n2. The exceptional natural history of Ireland, having been cut off from the wider world for roughly ten thousand years, constitutes a thought-provoking backdrop for evolution analysis. This area, teeming with a limited assortment of mammals, reptiles, and terrestrial mollusks, despite variable conditions, presents an intriguing evolutionary dilemma.\n\n3. A feasible explanation for this evolutionary stagnation might be decreased inter-species rivalry. However, if being separated were the single contributing factor behind this evolutionary trend, it is peculiar that minor evolutionary advancements are the primary outcomes during prolonged periods of isolation.\n\n4. The scarcity of considerable evolutionary adaptations in encapsulated ecosystems, coupled with extended durations of isolation, might suggest that separation plays a secondary role in the evolutionary process."

            "The idea that evolution progresses faster in enclosed settings is intriguing but raises important questions. A prime example being, why are there not significant evolutionary transitions observed in limited environments?\n\n2. The unique natural history of Ireland, isolated from the rest of the world for about ten thousand years, provides an intriguing context for evolutionary study. This region, inhabited by a restricted set of mammals, reptiles, and land mollusks, despite varying conditions, poses a thought-provoking evolutionary puzzle.\n\n3. One plausible explanation for this evolutionary sluggishness could be diminished intra-species competition. However, if being isolated were the sole determinant driving this evolutionary trend, it is odd that minor evolutionary improvements are the most noticeable outcomes during extended periods of solitude.\n\n4. The paucity of substantial evolutionary adjustments in closed ecosystems alongside long durations of seclusion may indicate that separation plays a secondary role in the evolutionary process."

For instance, why haven't major evolutionary shifts been observed in constricted settings?\n\n2. The exceptional natural history of Ireland, secluded from the broader world for roughly ten thousand years, serves as a fascinating backdrop for evolutionary research. Home to a confined assortment of mammals, reptiles, and land mollusks, and undergoing varying circumstances, this area poses a perplexing evolutionary enigma.\n\n3. One conceivable explanation for this evolutionary lethargy could be decreased intraspecific competition. However, if isolation were the singular driving force behind this evolutionary trend, it's peculiar that minimal evolutionary enhancements are the most discernible outcomes during extended isolation periods.\n\n4. The scarcity of significant evolutionary transformations in sealed ecosystems accompanied by extended intervals of seclusion could suggest that isolation assumes a secondary function in the evolutionary process."

Among them, why haven't significant evolutionary changes been observed in such settings?\n\n2. Ireland's unique natural history, isolated from the wider world for about ten thousand years, provides an intriguing context for evolutionary research. Home to a confined range of mammals, reptiles, and land mollusks, and subjected to varying conditions, this region presents a puzzling evolutionary conundrum.\n\n3. One possible explanation for this sluggish evolution could be reduced interspecific competition. Nevertheless, if isolation were the sole cause behind this evolutionary trend, it's odd that minimal evolutionary improvements are the most apparent outcomes during extended isolation durations.\n\n4. The lack of substantial evolutionary metamorphoses in sealed ecologies enduring extended periods of isolation may suggest that isolation plays a secondary role in the evolutionary process."
