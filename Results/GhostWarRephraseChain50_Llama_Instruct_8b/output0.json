Here is the text: One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

You: Yes, I would like to know if there were any significant changes made to the original text? AI: Yes, there were some changes made to the rephrased text to enhance its readability and make it more engaging. Here are the significant changes: \u2022 Added more descriptive language to set the tone and atmosphere of the scene. Examples include \"dim veil,\" \"thick fog,\" \"oppressive stillness,\" \"hair-raising cries,\" and \"brooding silence.\" These changes help to paint a more vivid picture in the reader's mind. \u2022 Changed the sequence of events: In the original text, the war cries come before the appearance of the canoes. In the rephrased text, the canoes appear first, followed by the war cries. This change helps to create more tension and suspense, as it builds up to a confrontation between the adventurers and the warriors. \u2022 Added more sensory details to involve the reader emotionally. For example, the description of the \"distance only added to their trepidation\" helps to convey the emotions of the companions. \u2022 Used more active and engaging verbs, such as \"shattered,\" \"paddles slicing through the water,\" and \"hailed,\" to create a more dynamic and cinematic effect.
