Here is the text: One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

            "Two young men from Egulac ventured to the river one evening for seal hunting. The tranquility of the night was disturbed by the arrival of a fog, followed by war cries. Believing they were under attack, the men fled to the shore and concealed themselves behind a log. Suddenly, canoes approached, and the sounds of paddles echoed through the stillness. Five men disembarked, intent on recruitment. One of the young hunters expressed his inability to participate, citing a lack of arrows and concern for his safety, as his relatives remained in the dark about his whereabouts. His companion, however, agreed to join the warriors. With that, the war party continued upriver to a town on the opposite side of Kalama. Uproar ensued as the peoples clashed, resulting in a significant loss of life. Yet, midway through the conflict, the young man discerned that one of the warriors had been struck down. Disbelief seized him as he pondered the possibility that these characters were spectral beings. Somehow unharmed despite their belief he had been wounded, he returned to Egulac, recounting the horror of the battle, only to succumb to his injuries as darkness fell.
