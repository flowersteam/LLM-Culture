Here is the text: One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

They swiftly fled to the shore and hid behind a log.Canoes appeared, paddles could be heard, and one canoe approached them. Five men were in the canoe, who expressed their wish to bring the young men with them for a war campaign.\n\nOne of the young men spoke up, saying, \"I have no ammunition.\"The men responded, \"Arrows are in the canoe.\" However, this young man refused to join, fearing for his life and his relatives' unawareness of his whereabouts. But the other young man was persuaded to go with them.\n\nThe warriors then headed upriver to a town opposite Kalama. A battle ensued, leaving many casualties on both sides. The young man who had accompanied the warriors began to hear one of them saying, \"Quick, let us return home; that Indian has been injured.\" He thought, \"They must be spirits.\" Though he felt no pain, they insisted he had been shot.\n\nThe canoes then returned to Egulac, and the young man went home. He gathered everyone around and narrated his experiences, \"I journeyed with the spirits, and we clashed in battle. Many of our people and those who attacked us perished.\" He recounted the entire tale, then grew still.\n\nWhen dawn broke, the young man collapsed. Something black emerged from his mouth, and his features twisted. The people reacted in horror and cried out, for he had passed away."
