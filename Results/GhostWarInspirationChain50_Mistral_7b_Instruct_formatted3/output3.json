Here is the text: One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

            "Two siblings, hailing from the serene hamlet by the riverbend of Eldenwood, prepared to harvest eels in the tranquil dusk. As the panorama morphed into a mystical haze, shrouding the terrain and calming the waters, they became aware of victorious battle cries. Seeking shelter behind a colossal pebbled ridge, they witnessed spectral canoes materialize. With paddles slicing effortlessly through the mist, eight stalwart men occupied the foremost canoe, issuing an invitation.\n\nThe eldest brother pondered, stating, \"My quiver has reached its limit.\" They amicably presented him with a quiver brimming with arrows, yet he stayed steadfast, citing, \"The tranquility of my tribe might be disrupted if I venture to an unexplored rift.\" His younger brother, however, saw this as a chance and opted to join the expedition.\n\nThese strangers rowed resolutely upriver towards the community of Orbe, encountering resistance and ensuing clashes. Many lives were extinguished by the Stopper's Bullets, guns that outrageously pierced the silence. Their scout, Clever Hunter, was abruptly hit but failed to acknowledge the wound. He claimed, \"These must be celestial protectors.\"\n\nThe assailants withdrew hurriedly, grateful for the misapprehension. The Wounded Brother followed the spiritual presence, recounting their triumphant tale at his hearth. Neighbors and Kinfolk gathered, Rumors of War intrigued, hanging onto each detail shared. As the sun's rays illuminated the morn, the brother's condition worsened. Blackness gushed from his lips, his countenance deformed, and his being vanished, leaving his loved ones devastated."

            "In the idyllic hamlet of Eldenwood, nestled by a peaceful riverbend, two siblings embarked on a quiet eel-harvesting expedition as the sun began to set. The landscape transformed into a magical twilight, enveloping the land and rendering the waters still. However, the tranquility was shattered by triumphant battle cries, causing the siblings to seek shelter behind a colossal pebbled ridge.\n\nAs they hid, ethereal canoes materialized, their paddles slicing smoothly through the mist. Six mighty warriors occupied the leading canoe and beckoned the siblings with warm greetings.\n\nThe elder brother hesitated, fearing the disruption of his serene tribe's order with an uncharted adventure. His loyal younger brother, however, saw this as a rare opportunity for excitement and accepted the invitation with open arms.\n\nTogether, the group embarked on a perilous journey upriver, encountering resistance and fierce encounters. Though sparingly used, the Stopper's Bullets - mysterious weapons capable of shattering silence - claimed numerous lives. The group's adept scout, Swift Archer, was struck by an arrow but remained stoic, insisting that these were celestial guardians defending their path.\n\nUpon their triumphant return, the Wounded Brother proudly recounted their tales of bravery at his hearth. A hushed crowd of villagers and kinfolk gathered, fascinated by the Rumors of War and in awe of the siblings' heroic deeds. As dawn broke over the horizon, however, the sun's rays brought an unsettling revelation. The Brother's condition worsened, and as blackness gushed from his lips, his once recognizable features twisted and distorted, leaving the loved ones behind in mourning."

However, the calm was disrupted by thunderous applause, urging them to take cover behind a colossal boulder.\n\nAs they hid, crystalline boats appeared from the shimmering waters, their oars cutting through the rippling surface with balanced precision. Seven valiant knights occupied the vanguard canoe, inviting the siblings with cordial salutations.\n\nThe elder sister hesitated, apprehensive of the disturbance to her community's harmony with an untested quest. Her courageous younger brother, on the other hand, saw it as a chance for adventure and eagerly accepted the knights' offer.\n\nTogether, they began their challenging journey across the lake, facing adversity and formidable opposition. Magic projectiles - the Enchanted Arrows - were deployed, defeating their enemies with titanic force. The group's skilled scout, the Fleetfoot Archer, was struck by an arrow but stayed resolute, explaining that these were celestial defenders protecting their path.\n\nUpon their victorious return, the Wounded Brother recounted their tales of valor at the village hearth. A reverent crowd of villagers and relatives assembled, captivated by the Whispers of Magic and in awe of the siblings' heroic actions. As the sun rose over the horizon, however, the siblings encountered a worrying revelation. The Brother's health continued to deteriorate, and as darkness stained his lips, his once familiar features twisted and changed, leaving his loved ones in heartbreak."

Eleven gallant knights manned the lead boat, extending amicable greetings to the startled siblings.\n\nThe eldest sister pondered, held back by her fear of disrupting her village's delicate balance via this unknown mission. Her brave younger brother, however, viewed it as an opportunity for excitement and gladly accepted the knights' bidding.\n\nHand in hand, they embarked on their arduous voyage across the lake, meeting adversity and daunting adversaries.
