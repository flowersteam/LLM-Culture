        "You will receive a text. Your task is to rephrase this text without modifying its meaning. Juste output your new text, nothing else.  Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

            "One argument against those who, like Mr. Gulick, consider isolation itself to be a driving force behind the modification of species warrants attention, namely, the complete lack of change where, if this were a genuine cause, we would expect to find evidence of it.",
            "One criticism of the idea that isolation is a factor in the modification of species, as championed by individuals such as Mr. Gulick, warrants consideration: the complete lack of change observed in regions, like Ireland, that have been separated from others, like Britain, for a very long period, namely thousands of years. Despite this prolonged isolation, it is remarkable that even the environmental differences, both organic and inorganic, have not led to the slightest transformation among Ireland's mammals, reptiles, or land mollusks. If natural selection is not responsible for this stability, it may be attributed to the milder struggle for existence due to the smaller number of competing species. However, if isolation were a conclusive factor, operating consistently and cumulatively, it is hard to comprehend why a notable change would not have developed over such a prolonged period. The absence of such change in Ireland and other isolated regions appears to suggest that isolation itself is not a causative agent in the modification of species."
