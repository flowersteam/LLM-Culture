        "You will receive a text. Your task is to rephrase this text without modifying its meaning. Juste output your new text, nothing else.  Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

            "One criticism of the idea that isolation is the primary cause of modification of species, as proposed by Mr. Gulick, warrants consideration. This is the striking lack of change in the species of Ireland, where the country has been separated from Britain for many thousands of years, and yet the majority of its mammal, reptile, and land mollusk species remain unchanged, despite distinct environmental differences. If isolation were indeed a driving force leading to modification, it is unprecedented that no significant change would have occurred over such a prolonged period. This apparent lack of change in Ireland and other isolated areas suggests that isolation alone is not sufficient to drive the process of modification.",
            "One argument against the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, propose isolation as a driving force behind species modification is worthy of consideration, specifically the complete lack of change observed in a region where, according to this theory, we would expect to see some. Ireland serves as a suitable case study, as it has been geographically isolated from Britain since the glacial period, which is several thousand years ago. Despite this separation, there has been no detectable change in Ireland's mammals, reptiles, or land snails, despite notable differences in their environment. The failure of species to evolve through natural selection might be attributed to the reduced competition for resources in Ireland, given the smaller number of competing species. However, if isolation were a constant and cumulative cause of modification, it is difficult to understand why significant changes would not have occurred over thousands of years. The absence of such changes in Ireland, as well as in other instances of isolation, suggests that isolation is not a primary driver of modification."
