        "You will receive a text. Your task is to rephrase this text without modifying its meaning. Juste output your new text, nothing else.  Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

            "It is worth considering an objection to the idea that isolation alone is responsible for the modification of species. Specifically, one can point to the case of Ireland, which has been separated from Britain since the end of the last ice age, a period of over a thousand years. Despite this isolation, there has been no noticeable change in the country's mammals, reptiles, or land snails, even though the environmental conditions differ substantially from those found in Britain. This may be attributed to the relatively weak competition for resources stemming from the smaller number of species present. However, if isolation were indeed a potent cause of change, it seems improbable that no notable transformation would have occurred over such a long period. The lack of evolutionary change in Ireland and other isolated regions suggests that isolation is not, in and of itself, a driving force behind species modification.",
            "One criticism of those who, akin to Mr. Gulick, argue that isolation alone leads to the modification of species warrants consideration, specifically, the complete lack of change in instances where, if this were a viable cause, significant alteration would be expected. Ireland presents an ideal testing ground, as it has been disconnected from Great Britain for at least thousands of years, and yet, with the exception of minor differences in environment, none of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs have undergone any discernible transformation. It is unclear whether this lack of transformation through natural selection is due to the less intense competition for resources resulting from the smaller number of competing species; however, if isolation were, in fact, a continuous and cumulative cause, it is difficult to comprehend why a noticeable change would not have occurred over thousands of years. The absence of change in this and numerous other instances of isolation suggests that isolation alone is not a driving force behind modification.",

In Ireland, a perfect test case, one knows that it has been separate from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, surely thousands of years ago. Notwithstanding, hardly any of its mammals, reptiles, or land snails have undergone even the slightest change, despite a distinct difference in both inorganic and organic environments. It is not surprising that natural selection has not led to changes, given the lesser struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species. However, if isolation were a reliable cause, continually and cumulatively acting, it is hard to believe that a noticeable change would not have occurred over thousands of years. As no such change has occurred in Ireland, and in many other cases of isolation, it would seem that isolation itself is not the cause of modification.",
            "A notable counterargument to the idea that isolation itself leads to the modification of species, as advocated by Mr. Gulick, is worthy of consideration. This criticism points out the absence of change in Ireland, where its separation from Britain at the end of the glacial epoch, thousands of years ago, would have been expected to induce modifications if isolation were a true cause. Despite this prolonged period of isolation, the vast majority of Ireland's mammals, reptiles, and land molluscs remained unchanged, despite noticeable differences in both inorganic and organic environments. While it is possible that the less intense competition for resources in Ireland, stemming from the smaller number of competing species, contributed to the lack of changes through natural selection, it is difficult to explain why no decisive changes would not have occurred over thousands of years if isolation were a continuous and cumulative force. The fact that no such changes have been observed in Ireland or other isolated cases suggests that isolation, in and of itself, is not a driving force behind modification."
