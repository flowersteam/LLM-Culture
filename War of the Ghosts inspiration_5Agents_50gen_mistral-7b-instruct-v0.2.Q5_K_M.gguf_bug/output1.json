Here is the text: One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

They instinctively concealed themselves behind a large log, fearing a raid.\n\nAs the moon began to rise, canoes started appearing on the misty water, their paddles slicing through the calm surface. Five determined warriors approached their hiding spot, their faces painted with war marks and their eyes blazing with battle fury.\n\n\"Where are your weapons?\" they demanded, their voices tense with urgency. \"There are none here,\" one of the brothers replied, his heart pounding in his chest. \"We have come only to hunt beavers,\" he added quickly.\n\n\"Arms are in the canoe,\" the warriors responded, their tone leaving no room for refusal. The other brother hesitated, his thoughts racing. He knew that venturing into a war party could be a death sentence with his whereabouts unknown to his family.\n\n\"You may go with us,\" he urged his brother, sensing an opportunity.

The battle was fierce and deadly, leaving many casualties on both sides.\n\nBut eventually, victory came to the warriors, and they returned to their village with tales of bravery and sacrifice. The brother who had remained behind was stunned to learn that one of the warriors had been hit during the battle and had perished on the journey back, with the fallen warrior occupying the same seat as the survivor in the canoe.\n\nUpon his return, the brother recounted his incredible adventure to his family and friends, who listened in awe at his detailed account of the encounter.

            "Under the shroud of night, two brave Chinook men from the village of Wahkiyu set off towards the river, intending to hunt seals for their community. The atmosphere suddenly transformed, with thick fog obscuring their vision and still waters mirroring the serene sky above. However, their tranquility was shattered when they heard bloodcurdling war cries echoing along the river.\n\nAssuming it was an enemy war party approaching, they hid behind the protective cover of a large fallen log. As their hearts pounded, the sound of canoes approaching grew louder, with the gentle rhythm of paddles beating the water in a steady, menacing rhythm.\n\nFive fearsome warriors emerged from the murk, seeking the companionship of their victims. 'You have the appearance of strong warriors,' they called out in a mix of curiosity and assertion. 'We invite you to join us. We venture upriver to wage war on the Tilomikh people.'\n\nOne man hesitated, fear etched onto his expression. 'My apologies, esteemed warriors, but I have yet to gather enough arrows for this endeavor. If I were to accompany you, I risk falling in combat, and my loved ones would not know of my whereabouts.'\n\nHis companion, however, saw an opportunity for adventure and Battle Honor. 'I, too, am prepared. I'll join you in our noble quest.'\n\nThe two men's paths diverged, and as the warriors departed, a small village at the base of Mount St. Helens appeared on the opposite side of the Klickitat River. Their arrival brought unsettling tension, and soon enough, battle commenced.\n\nLost in the chaos of the clashing multitudes, the young man remained unscathed, yet heard his comrades' cries of injury. A chilling realization struck him. Could these be spirit warriors? Each life he saw taken, both his people and those who opposed, strengthened his conviction: These were, indeed, the supernatural guardians of war.\n\nWith the sun rising above the battlefield, the young man, now known as \"The Brave Teller,\" ventured back to his village. Foolshardy, his kin welcomed the tale of the otherworldly encounter, and the echoes of the battle that unfolded on the river seemed to transcend",

A haunting cry echoed, sending shivers down their spines. \"'Tis a war call,\" they guessed, frantically fleeing towards the shore. Hiding behind a giant log, they watched in dread as canoes appeared on the horizon. Five men occupied one of them, offering an invitation.\n\n\"We're headed upriver to wage war,\" they declared. One of the boys hesitated, \"My arrows remain in the canoe - I may not return.\" The other was summarily coaxed, \"Come on, you may join the victory.\" Reluctantly, one boy agreed, while the other returned home.\n\nThe warriors continued their mission, crossing the river to an unsuspecting village. A brutal battle ensued, with lives being prematurely extinguished. Yet, the boy who joined soon heard a plea, \"Hasten, we must leave - that tribesman has been struck.\" Grotesquely, he pondered, \"Perchance, ghostly spirits.\" Though he felt unharmed, they insisted he had been wounded.\n\nBack in Egulac, the war canoes returned, carrying the boy safely home. A campfire was prepared, and he shared his experience. \"I journeyed with the ethereal, and we waged war.\" Casualties mounted, but his own people were left shell-shocked.\n\nWhen dawn arrived, the boy, having shared his tale, grew still. Suddenly, a dark substance escaped from his mouth, his features morphed, and his life left us. The people mourned deeply as another brave soul was claimed.",

They quickly hid behind the protection of a large log, watching as enemy canoes emerged from the fog.\n\nSix men hailed them, eagerness in their eyes and weapons at the ready. 'We wish to invite you,' they offered, 'to join us on our journey to bring down our rivals upriver.' One warrior hesitated, 'I have no arrows,' he announced, fear gripping his heart as he thought of his family, left unaware of his whereabouts. But the other, filled with a strong sense of duty, agreed to accompany the war party.\n\nLeaving his friend behind, the warrior embarked on a perilous journey to an enemy village. As the first light of dawn broke, they fought fiercely, and many lives were claimed. But it wasn't long before the victorious warriors heard the dreaded words, 'He has been struck down.' Fearful that his companion had indeed met his end, the warrior realized their enemies were no mere men.\n\nReturning to Egulac, our brave hero recounted the tale of his ghostly encounters to his tribe. They gathered around the fire, spellbound by his story; a tale of victory, despite the loss of life on both sides. But as the sun rose and the stark reality dawned upon them, the warrior succumbed to the wound that had been inflicted upon him. His lifeless body fell to the ground, a symbol of the cost of war.",

They hid, beads of sweat forming on their brows as canoes approached, filled with fierce warriors. One brother pleaded, \"I have no weapons.\" The warriors reassured him, \"Spears are in the canoe.\" But fear gripped him, and he refused to join the battle. So, one brother embarked on the war-bound voyage, while the other returned to his loved ones, leaving a trail of uncertainty behind.\n\nThe voyage led upriver to a fortified village, and war erupted between the two tribes. The deafening clash of weapons rang through the night, claiming countless lives on both sides. But as the young warrior heard a fellow warriors' cry, \"Quick, let us flee,\" he believed them to be spirits. In their shock, they had mistaken a wound for a fatal injury.\n\nA few hours later, the boats bearing the ghostly warriors returned to their village.
