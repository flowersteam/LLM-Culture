Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

            "In the realm of artificial intelligence, a similar conundrum arises when examining the alleged correlation between processing speed and cognitive improvement. One could argue that if faster processing were a fundamental factor in enhancing mental faculties, we would expect to see a direct link between the two. However, numerous studies have yielded inconclusive results, with some participants demonstrating enhanced cognitive abilities despite subpar processing speeds. A possible explanation lies in the fact that other factors, such as education and social interaction, play a more significant role in cognitive development. The absence of a clear correlation between processing speed and cognitive improvement suggests that this factor alone is not sufficient to explain observed changes.",
            "In the era of virtual relationships, we have an intriguing case of the \"lonely algorithms\" phenomenon, where the absence of human interaction has not led to any distinct changes in the underlying code. Despite the significant disparity in the virtual environments and the organic feedback from users, the algorithms remain remarkably consistent across platforms, defying the intuition that isolation would accelerate innovation and optimization. Perhaps the milder competition among digital entities, compared to the cutthroat struggle among natural species, has diminished the pressure for evolutionary advancements. Conversely, this stagnation suggests that mere isolation, even in the digital realm, may not be a sufficient catalyst for modifications, and other factors must be considered."

Perhaps the relatively peaceful nature of culinary collaborations, compared to the cutthroat competition among plant species for nutrients and resources, has reduced the impetus for new discoveries.
