Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

To illustrate this, consider Ireland as a prime example. Separated from Britain since the end of the glacial period, certainly for many thousands of years, we find that nearly no mammal, reptile, or land mollusk has undergone any alteration at all. This is despite a distinct difference in both inorganic and organic environments.\n\nIt may be that changes haven't occurred through natural selection, possibly due to the milder struggle for existence resulting from fewer competing species. However, if isolation were acting as a continuous and cumulative efficient cause, it seems implausible that a significant change would not have occurred over thousands of years.
