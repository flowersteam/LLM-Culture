Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

Specifically, where isolation would be expected to result in change, as is the case with Ireland, which has been separated from Britain since the glacial period, and despite considerable environmental differences, no species have undergone as much as a slight modification. This lack of change cannot be attributed solely to the absence of natural selection, as the struggle for existence may be less intense due to the smaller number of competing species; however, if isolation were a continuous and cumulative force, it is hard to imagine that no observable change would have occurred over thousands of years. The fact that no such change has been seen in Ireland and similar cases of isolation suggests that isolation is not, on its own, a source of modification."
