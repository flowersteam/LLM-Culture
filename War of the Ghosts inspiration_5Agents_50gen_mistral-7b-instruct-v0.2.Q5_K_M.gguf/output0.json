Here is the text: One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

            "Two Brothers' Encounter with the Unknown: A Tale of the River's Edge\n\nOnce upon a moonlit night, two courageous brothers from the Egulac tribe embarked on a seal hunting expedition along the tranquil riverbanks. The scene was serene; the air held a heavy, foggy calm. Suddenly, an eerie stillness descended. Then, the chilling war-cries of their adversaries echoed through the haze. The brothers exchanged a nerve-wracking glance, sensing that an impending battle was at hand. They swiftly retreated to the shore, finding refuge behind the sheltering log.\n\nSoon, the inky pixels of canoes emerged from the enveloping fog, their approaches heralded by the muffled, rhythmic sounds of paddles. Five fierce warriors emerged, their faces painted with the markings of war. They addressed the boys:\n\n\"Join us in our sacred quest for vengeance! We are heading to wreak havoc on our enemies. Come, be a part of this epic tale of war and triumph!\"\n\nThe eldest brother hesitated, explaining, \"I lack the weaponry to participate. I do not wish to endanger my life, putting my own safety in doubt. My kinfolk remain unaware of my whereabouts.\"\n\nHis younger brother, however, felt a thrill of bravery pulsating through his veins. He declared, \"I am ready to join you!\"\n\nThe brothers went their separate ways. The warriors continued onward to the town on the opposite side of the Kalama, where a fierce battle erupted, unfurling a tapestry of bloodshed. The younger brother, unscathed, found refuge with the ghostly spirits in their war canoe.\n\nWhen they returned to Egulac, the boy indifferently informed his community about his adventure with the spectral warriors. He shared the tale of the bloodlust and the ensuing carnage. Before long, exhaustion took hold, and as the sun rose, the boy collapsed. A black, inky substance oozed from his mouth. His relatives recoiled in terror. The unthinkable had occurred: their brave young warrior had succumbed to death.",
