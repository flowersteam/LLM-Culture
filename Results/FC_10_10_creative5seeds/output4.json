Life was peaceful and content, until one day when a mysterious twist of fate would turn everything upside down.\n\nA new stranger arrived in the village. His name was Dorian, and no one seemed to know where he had come from. He was a man of many secrets, always dressed in all black, with a hood that covered his face.
