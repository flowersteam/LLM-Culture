Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

A significant point is the complete lack of transformation in a setting where, if this were a valid causative factor, we would anticipate observing it. Ireland serves as a prime example, as it has been isolated from Britain since the conclusion of the glacial era, a timespan of numerous thousand years. Remarkably, very few of its mammals, reptiles, or land mollusks have undergone any transformation, notwithstanding the clear environmental disparities, both organic and inorganic. The absence of transformation through natural selection might be attributed to the less intense competition among a reduced number of species. However, if isolation were a consistently and cumulatively effective cause, it is inconceivable that a significant change would not have emerged over thousands of years.

For example, Ireland, which has been detached from Britain since the end of the ice age, a timeframe of tens of thousands of years. Despite the obvious ecological and biological disparities between the two, Ireland's mammals, reptiles, and land snails exhibit minimal signs of evolution. The paucity of evolution through natural selection might be attributable to reduced competition among fewer species. Nevertheless, if isolation is a dependable and powerfully influential element, the absence of significant alterations over thousands of years is surprising. The absence of such alterations in this instance and numerous others suggests that it might not be the sole cause of change. ##TEXTEND##"

It is striking that there appears to be a notable lack of evolution in situations where, if isolation had a significant impact, we would expect to observe it. For instance, Ireland, which has been separated from Britain since the end of the ice age, a timespan of tens of thousands of years. Despite the clear ecological and biological differences between the two, Ireland's mammals, reptiles, and land snails show minimal evidence of evolution. The scarcity of evolution through natural selection could be due to less competition among fewer species. However, if isolation is a reliable and strongly influential factor, the lack of significant changes over thousands of years is puzzling. The lack of such changes in this case and many others suggests that it might not be the only cause of change. ##TEXTEND##"
