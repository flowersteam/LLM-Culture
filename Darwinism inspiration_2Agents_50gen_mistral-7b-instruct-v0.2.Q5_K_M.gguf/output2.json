Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

            "In the realm of biological evolution, an intriguing debate persists among scholars regarding the impact of isolation on species modification. One prominent figure in this discourse is Mr. Gulick, who posits that isolation itself is a significant driving force behind speciation. However, there exists a compelling counterargument, influenced by the striking lack of transformation in certain isolated environments.\n\nConsider, for example, the fascinating case of Ireland, which has been geographically separated from Britain since the end of the last ice age. We can approximate this duration to be over 15,000 years. Yet, despite this prolonged isolation, one observes minimal alteration among the island's mammals, reptiles, and land mollusks.\n\nDespite the considerable differences in the inorganic and organic environments between Ireland and Britain, no evolutionary shifts have manifested - a finding that challenges the views of those who maintain that isolation is an essential cause of modification.\n\nSome scientists argue that the paucity of observed changes could stem from a relatively benign struggle for existence in Ireland, with fewer competing species compared to other regions. However, if isolation were an inherently effective catalyst for evolution, its continuous influence ought to have generated noticeable alterations over millennia.\n\nThe absence of significant change in Ireland, and numerous analogous situations, raises the tantalizing question: Is isolation, in fact, an driving force behind evolution or merely an incidental factor?",
            "In the realm of biology, the hypothesis that isolation drives species evolution is not without debate. Mr. Gulick's perspective, while compelling, lacks sufficient evidence, as demonstrated by the case of Ireland.\n\nDivided from Britain since the ice age, Ireland has been a prime example for those seeking to validate the theory of isolation-driven species modification. Yet, despite this lengthy separation and distinct environmental differences, the Irish fauna - mammals, reptiles, and land mollusks - have shown minimal, if any, signs of evolution.\n\nOne potential argument against this is the reduced pressure for natural selection, given the smaller number of competing species. However, the absence of change across numerous cases of isolation raises further questions.\n\nGiven the consistent environmental changes and the vast timeframes involving these instances, it is astounding that no significant alterations have emerged. Ireland's unaltered fauna presents evidence that challenges the notion that isolation is an inherent cause of modification."

Mr. Gulick, an influential voice in this debate, asserts that isolation plays a crucial role in speciation. However, a thought-provoking opposition arises from the curious case of Ireland, which has been geographically set apart from Britain since the ice age.\n\nDespite the long-lasting boundary between the two lands, Ireland's fauna - mammals, reptiles, and land mollusks - have displayed only subtle adaptations or none at all, defying expectations of notable modification driven by isolation.\n\nWhile some propose that the reduced competition for resources in Ireland might explain the paucity of observed changes, the enigma lingers: If isolation is an inherent catalyst for evolution, why are there minimal observable alterations in prolonged isolated environments like Ireland?\n\nThis perplexing situation invites further exploration and discussion within the scientific community, fueling the fascinating discourse surrounding the role of isolation in biological evolution.",
            "In the realm of biology, the debate over the role of isolation in driving species evolution continues to intrigue scholars. Mr. Gulick's theory, advocating for the significance of isolation, is thought-provoking yet contested. A pertinent example of this controversy can be found in the case of Ireland, separated from Britain since the ice age.\n\nDespite the significant geological separation, the Irish fauna - including mammals, reptiles, and land mollusks - has remained largely unchanged for over 15,000 years. Despite the distinct environmental contrasts between the two territories, the Irish fauna's failure to evolve in noticeable ways challenges the beliefs of those who attribute speciation to isolation.\n\nSome scientists argue that a lack of competition could explain the absence of significant changes. However, the consistency of this pattern in various isolated instances raises important questions.\n\nGiven the prolonged environmental shifts and immense timeframes, one would expect to see considerable alterations emerge. The fact that Ireland's fauna remains unchanged raises doubt about the inherent role of isolation in shaping species' evolution."
