Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

            "In the realm of biological theory, an argument against the opinions held by Mr. Gulick and those who posit isolation as a catalyst for species transformation merits consideration. An intriguing observation emerged from Ireland, where we find an anomalous situation that challenges this notion: no discernible modifications have taken place within the mammal, reptile, and land mollusk populations, despite their separation from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch.\n\nYet, if isolation were an indisputable catalyst, we would have observed noticeable shifts in these species. Ireland stands as a compelling example, with its unique ecosystems revealing distinct differences in the inorganic and organic environments compared to Britain. However, the similarites between the two species pools remain striking. This mere sameness contradicts the assumption that isolation is an efficient cause of modification, acting in a continuous and cumulative manner.\n\nIn the annals of natural history, we encounter comparable cases, such as those of remote oceanic islands or geographically separated regions, yet, no appreciable changes have been documented within their fauna, raising the question: is isolation an intrinsic cause of species modification?\n\nIn Ireland, the absence of modification in the face of long-term isolation suggests an alternative explanation, perhaps a less pronounced struggle for existence as a result of the smaller number of competing species. Nevertheless, the evidence from this test case, in addition to others, sheds light on a seemingly insurmountable truth: the prevailing forces in shaping species may not be so straightforwardly attributed to isolation alone.",
            "It is perplexing that proponents of the isolation-as-a-cause-of-species-modification theory, such as Mr. Gulick, fail to consider a compelling counterargument: the unexpected stability in species during prolonged isolation. Take, for instance, the unique situation in Ireland. Separated from Britain since the end of the last glacial period, approximately 20,000 years ago, this island offers an excellent opportunity to investigate potential impacts of isolation on the biosphere.\n\nHowever, as we observe the island's mammals, reptiles, and terrestrial mollusks, a striking pattern emerges \u2013 an absence of any evident changes. In fact, the environment in Ireland bears distinctive differences, both inorganic and organic, compared to Britain. Yet, strikingly, the species have remained unaltered over millennia.\n\nOne potential explanation for this observation could be the reduced competition among species on the island, leading to a milder struggle for existence. Nevertheless, if isolation itself were an influential driving force behind modifications, as Mr. Gulick advocates, it is inexplicable that such a substantial change has not transpired in Ireland over thousands of years or in numerous other comparable situations. This steady state in species distribution in the context of isolation bolsters the argument that it is not, in itself, a cause of modification."

            "An intriguing counterargument to the theory that isolation drives species modification has surfaced through the investigation of Ireland's biosphere. Considering the island's separation from Britain since the last glacial period, approximately 20,000 years ago, one might expect significant shifts in the mammal, reptile, and land mollusk populations due to their isolation. Yet, an intriguing observation emerges - these species have maintained remarkable similarities to their British counterparts, despite the distinct differences in their environmental conditions.\n\nIn light of this evidence, a possible explanation could be the diminished competition among species on the island, contributing to a less intense struggle for existence. However, if isolation were truly the primary cause of species transformation, as some argue, it remains a mystery why such substantial changes have not occurred in Ireland or other comparable settings after thousands of years.\n\nThis consistent pattern in species distribution within isolated environments begs the question: Is isolation an inherent driving force behind modifications, or are other factors at play?\n\nExploring the annals of natural history, we find comparable case studies, such as remote oceanic islands and geographically separated regions, which likewise show few discernible changes within their faunas. Collectively, these findings challenge the widely held assumption that isolation is an uncontested cause of species modification. Instead, the prevailing forces shaping species may prove to be more complex and multifaceted than previously assumed.",

However, an astonishing pattern surfaces \u2013 no modifications have been detected despite the unique ecosystems and drastic differences in the inorganic and organic environments.\n\nThe intriguing lack of change raises the question: if isolation is a decisive force in shaping species, why has it not produced significant differences in the Irish biosphere? Although the reduced competition among species may somewhat explain the stability, the fact remains that the species in Ireland bear striking similarities to their British counterparts, contradicting the isolation-as-a-cause-of-modification theory's premise.\n\nIn sum, while the consensus suggests that isolation is an indispensable factor in species transformation, the Irish situation presents a compelling challenge: the persistence of similarities between species pools over extended periods of isolation. Exploring alternative explanations, such as the milder struggle for existence, sheds light on the complex interactions between species and their environments."
