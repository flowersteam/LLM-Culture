I will give you a full account of the system and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the heart, the master-builder of romantic happiness. No one rejects or dislikes the joy of true love itself, for it is their love that they desire. But when those who do not know how to pursue their love wisely encounter difficulties that are extremely heart-wrenching, they start to denounce and avoid love. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires heartache of itself, because it is heartache, but every person sometimes finds themselves in circumstances where heartache and toil can procure them some great joy or happiness in love.
