Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

Ireland serves as a prime example, having been separated from Britain since the end of the last ice age. Despite this, there has been no discernible change in its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs, despite distinct differences in both organic and inorganic environments. It is unlikely that natural selection is the reason for this lack of change, as the fewer competing species in Ireland may have led to a less intense struggle for existence.

Ireland's history serves as a compelling illustration, having been separated from Britain since the last ice age. Despite these decades-long environmental distinctions, there has been no perceptible alteration in its mammalian, reptilian, or land mollusk populations. It is improbable that natural selection is responsible for this persistence of stability, as the reduced competition in Ireland may have led to a less intense survival struggle.
