Here is the text: One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

            "Under the cover of a foggy night, two friends from the village of Egulac set out to the river shores for their regular hunting routine, seeking to catch some seals. Suddenly, the serenity was broken by distant war-cries, causing them to worry and contemplate the possibility of an approaching war-party. They decided to take cover behind a log, cautiously observing as canoes filled with warriors approached. The warriors, noticing the hidden men, invited them to join their war party, heading upstream to battle another village. Lacking the necessary weapons and concerned for his safety, one man declined the offer, but his friend decided to go along.\n\nAs the war canoes journeyed up the river to the distant village, the young man witnessed the ferocity of the battle unfold. To his surprise, after the fight, he heard the warriors expressing concern that an enemy had injured him. The man wasn't feeling any pain, but soon realized the supernatural powers of his ghostly companions when he experienced the leakage of some dark substance from his mouth upon returning to his home village. Overwhelmed by fear, the people cried out, and before the break of dawn, the young man had succumbed to his mysterious injury, leaving the villagers in a state of shock and despair."

Their tranquil solitude was disrupted by a distant, muffled thud of drums, instilling in them a profound sense of unease. Seeking cover behind a towering oak, they watched as a fleet of soldiers approached, their armor glinting in the twilight.\n\nThe soldiers, spotting the concealed figures, beckoned them closer, urging them to join their ranks in a looming attack on an isolated village downstream. Fear gripping one, he declined, but curiosity and an insatiable hunger for thrill propelled the other to comply.\n\nAs they rowed down the river towards their objective, the adventurous companion witnessed the grim realities of conflict and the ruthless brutality that warfare brought along.
