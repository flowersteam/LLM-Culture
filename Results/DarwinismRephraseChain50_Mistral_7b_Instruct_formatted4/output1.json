Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

            "The argument against the theory of those, such as Mr. Gulick, who consider seclusion as a catalyst for species transformation merits consideration. One major concern lies in the lack of transformation in areas where we would anticipate it based on this theory. A notable example can be found in Ireland, where there has been a clear separation from Britain since the glacial period, believed to span several thousand years. However, not one of Ireland's mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has exhibited any discernible change, despite significant environmental differences both inorganic and organic. If isolation were a genuine causative factor, we would expect to see variation in these species as a result of the prolonged separation.\n\nNevertheless, it's feasible that the absence of transformation may be attributable to the less pronounced competition among species, reducing the intensity of the struggle for existence. Despite this possibility, it is hard to accept that such a marked change wouldn't have been initiated, given the millennia-long isolation.\n\nThe paucity of transformation in Ireland and other similar cases of isolation raises questions about the role of seclusion as a primary driver of modification."

            "The controversy surrounding the theory that seclusion triggers species transformation, as proposed by individuals like Mr. Gulick, is worth examining. A significant point of contention is the absence of observable transformation in regions where this theory would predict it. A striking illustration is provided by Ireland, which has been geographically distinct from Britain since the glacial period, assumed to last many thousands of years. However, none of Ireland's mammals, reptiles, or terrestrial mollusks have demonstrated any noticeable alterations, even while facing distinct environmental differences, both inorganic and organic. If separation were the root cause, we would anticipate observing variations in these species as a consequence of the extended separation.\n\n2. However, it's plausible that the absence of transformation could be explained by the relatively modest competition among species, which in turn decreases the level of the struggle for existence. Nevertheless, it's difficult to accept that such a pronounced change wouldn't have been instigated, given the immense period of isolation.\n\n3.

Considering the lengthy period of separation, it's reasonable to expect some variations among these species if isolation were indeed a significant catalyst.\n\n2.

Nevertheless, it's hard to believe that such a profound change wouldn't have occurred, given the long-lasting isolation.\n\n3.
