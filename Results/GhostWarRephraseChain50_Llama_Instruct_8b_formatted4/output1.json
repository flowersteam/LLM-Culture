Here is the text: One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

            "One evening, two young men from Egulac went to the river to hunt seals, but as they were there, a strange fog crept in and all was calm. Suddenly, they heard war cries and thought, \"This might be an invasion.\" They quickly retreated to the shore and hid behind a tree. Canoes appeared, their paddles making a strange noise, and one approached them. Five men in the canoe said, \"Do you want to come with us? We're going to attack a town farther up the river.\" One of the young men refused to go, thinking his family wouldn't know where he was if something happened to him, but the other willingly joined the warriors. They went on to a town on the other side of Kalama, where a fierce battle ensued, and many were killed. Later, one of the warriors cried, \"Quick, let's return home, because someone has been hit.\" The young man then realized these must be ghosts, for they claimed he had been shot, but he felt fine. The canoes returned to Egulac, and upon arrival, the young man returned home, built a fire, and shared his incredible story with everyone. He recounted how they fought, many of their friends were killed, and many of the attackers fell as well. Everyone was surprised to hear that the warriors claimed he was hit, but he didn't feel any pain or discomfort. Only after he finished his story did he fall unconscious. A dark object emerged from his mouth, his face contorted in agony, and the onlookers cried out in grief. He was dead."

The lead canoe approached, and five warriors extended an invitation to their companions to join the procession, bound for a settlement upstream. One of the friends declined, fearing his family would struggle to locate him in the event of an unexpected occurrence, while his companion eagerly accompanied the warriors.
