Here is the text: One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

The air was sweet with the scent of blooming lavender, and the sound of crickets filled the night air. As they wandered deeper into the forest, they stumbled upon a strange clearing, and in the center, a glowing stone seemed to pulse with an otherworldly energy. The cousins froze, their hearts racing in unison. Suddenly, the stone began to speak to them in a low, rumbling voice, offering them a deal: in exchange for their presence, it would grant them unimaginable power.

Then they heard rustling in the bushes, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a monster'. They froze in their tracks, and observed the shadows. Now, a group of creatures emerged, and they saw six eyes glowing in the dark. 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going deep into the forest to play our ancient game'. One of the sisters said,'I have no feathers.' 'Feathers are in the cave,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might get lost. My family does not know where I have gone. But you,' she said, turning to the other, 'may join us.' So one of the sisters went, but the other returned to the village. And the creatures went on deep into the forest to a hidden clearing. They started to dance and chant, and the air was filled with an otherworldly energy. But presently one of the creatures whispered, 'Shh, don't disturb the balance: that one is out of sync.' Now she thought: 'Oh, they are enchanted beings.' She didn't feel out of place, but they said she was disrupting the harmony. So the creatures returned to the heart of the forest, and the sister went back to her village, her heart pulsing with wonder. And she told everybody and said: 'Behold I danced with the mystics, and we performed the ancient rite. The forest was alive with power, and the balance was maintained. They said I was unbalanced, and I didn't feel troubled.' She told it all, and then she became quiet. When the moon rose high in the sky, she vanished into the night, never to be seen again."
