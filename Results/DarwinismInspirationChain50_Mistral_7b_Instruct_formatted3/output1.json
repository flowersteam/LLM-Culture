Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

Notably, a compelling objection merits scrutiny: the dearth of transformation in regions where, theoretically, alterations should have taken place.\n\nEngage in the discussion about Ireland \u2013 an intriguing example of long-term separation, evident since the retreat of the glacial epoch, estimated to span tens of thousands of years. Given this, the absence of any adaptation among its mammals, reptiles, and terrestrial mollusks is remarkable. Irish fauna shows little variance compared to its twin across the Irish Sea.\n\nThough the reason for this stasis may lie in the less vigorous competition among species prompted by the relative scarcity of contenders, the paucity of discernible change in numerous instances of isolation raises a significant question: how can isolation, if it truly holds transformative power, explain the persistent status quo within these secluded ecosystems?\n\nAfter all, if this notion is valid, how could thousands of years fail to yield a visible change in these environments distinct both in organic and inorganic aspects? These observations reinforce the notion that isolation may not serve as a primary catalyst for species alteration."

The paucity of variation in regions where evolution is expected to occur poses a significant challenge.\n\nConsider the distant land of New Zealand, a renowned illustration of prolonged isolation, dating back to the end of the last ice age, approximately forty thousand years ago. However, the absence of dramatic evolutionary shifts among its fauna, such as birds, reptiles, and invertebrates, is noteworthy. New Zealand's fauna displays strikingly few distinctions compared to its geographical counterpart across the Tasman Sea.\n\nThough the explanation for this stability might lie in the reduced competition among species due to the scarcity of competitors, the scarcity of noticeable change in numerous isolated ecosystems raises an essential query. If isolation holds substantial power to initiate transformative changes, how can these isolated environments maintain their consistent state for thousands of years?\n\nIndeed, if this premise is accurate, how could such vast stretches of time fail to produce noticeable modifications in these unique and distinct ecosystems, both in terms of organic components and inorganic structures?
