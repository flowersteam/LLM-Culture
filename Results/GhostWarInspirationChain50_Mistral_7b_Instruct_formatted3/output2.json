Here is the text: One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

            "Two young friends from the peaceful village of Wiyot set out one tranquil evening to fish for sturgeon by the riverbank. As twilight settled and the night grew still, a serene fog rolled in. Unsettled by the quiet, they suddently heard war cries haltingly carried on the wind. Their hearts pounded as they deliberated: 'Could this be a hostile raiding party?' They swiftly fled to concealment behind a large boulder. Dark canoes materialized through the mist, their paddles slicing the water with a stealthy rhythm. Six men filled the lead canoe, their faces grim and resolute.\n\n\"Come,\" they urged, extending their hands. \"We invite you to join us. We are embarking on a journey to defend our tribe against an enemy upstream.\"\n\nOne friend hesitated, saying, \"I lack the necessary weapons.\" The warriors responded, \"Fear not, the arms await in our canoe. Refusal may lead to tragic and untimely ends. But you, my companion, are free to proceed with us.\" And so, the first friend hesitated no longer, waiting for his companion to make his choice.\n\nThe men of war set forth, their determined hearts stirring tales that would be whispered through generations. The second friend, left behind, returned to his village, alerting the others and warning them of the battle to come. Morning found him recounting his ghostly escort and the brutal conflict's aftermath: enormous casualties on both sides, a tale not for the faint of heart. Yet, eventually, exhaustion overtook him, and, as night fell, something dark snaked from his lifeless mouth. The people cried out in pity and fear as the once vibrant friend ceased to breathe."

            "Two unlikely companions, hailing from the secluded hamlet of Nantahala, embarked on an adventure one moonlit eve by the riverbank to catch elusive catfish. As darkness enveloped the landscape and somber tranquility seized the night, an eerie fog descended - a frontier of trepidation. Startled by the silence, they were abruptly jolted by unfamiliar war cries echoing on the breeze. Their heartbeats quickened as they pondered, 'Could this be an encroaching enemy?' They hurriedly concealed themselves behind a gargantuan boulder. Bloodthirsty silhouettes appeared from the fog, their canoes slicing the water with a menacing rhythm. A dozen men occupied the lead canoe, their faces stern and unyielding.\n\n\"Come forth,\" they summoned, offering their hands. \"We welcome you to join us on this extraordinary quest. We are departing to safeguard our lands against adversaries upstream.\"\n\nThe first friend hesitated, questioning, \"I am unequipped with adequate weaponry.\" The warriors soothed, \"Do not fret, weapons await you in our vessel. Denial may foster perilous and disastrous consequences. But you, my confidant, are free to make your decision.\"\n\nIn the face of uncertainty, the second friend made a snap decision, rallying his fellow villagers and urging preparations for battle. That eventide, he retold his spectral encounter and the devastating consequences of the impending clash. Casualties were rampant on both sides, an unforgiving tale that left the faint of heart quivering. Yet, as dawn approached, something wholly sinister exuded from his deceased lips. The villagers mourned, their sorrow mingling with fear and freedom as the lifeless friend took his final breath."

As the night crept in, cloaking the scenery in stillness, a mystifying fog rolled in - a harbinger of apprehension. Sudden tranquility shattered by the silence, they were urged on by ominous, unfamiliar chanting on the wind. Their pulse raced as they debated, 'Is this the omen of a looming peril?' They sought shelter behind a colossal rock. Savage shadows emerged from the fog, their canoes cutting through the water with a sinister cadence. A score of figures filled their foremost canoe, their visages hardened and relentless.\n\n\"Present yourselves,\" they beckoned, extending their hands. \"We extend to you a place in this epic endeavor. We are departing to fortify our territory against foes further upstream.\"\n\nThe first comrade deliberated, pondering, \"I lack the fitting armaments.\" The warriors reassured, \"Fear not, your weapons await you within our boat. Hesitation could bring about dire and disastrous repercussions. Yet, you, my faithful ally, have the freedom to decide.\"\n\nIn the grip of doubt, the second companion made a split-second call to action, inspiring the preparations among the villagers for an impending confrontation. That very night, he recounted his spectral encounter and the colossal toll of the ensuing struggle. Losses abounded on both sides, a haunting narrative that left even the bravest trembling. Yet, as the dawn awakened, a chilling aura emerged from his lifeless lips. The villagers mourned, their grief intertwined with dread and liberation as the fallen friend took his final breath."
