Here is the text: One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

            "One dark night, two young men from Egulac ventured down to the river to hunt seals, only to be enveloped in a thick fog and an eerie calm. Suddenly, they were startled by war cries, and believing it might be a war party, they hastened to the shore, hiding behind a log as canoes appeared.

Later, they heard war cries, and thinking it might be a war party, they fled to the shore and hid behind a log. Then, they heard the sound of paddles and saw a canoe approaching, carrying five men who asked them to join in making war on the people. One of the young men, feeling uneasy, said, \"I don't have any arrows, but 'arrows are in the canoe,' they replied. I won't go because I might be killed and my relatives wouldn't know where I'd gone. But you, you can go with them.\" As a result, one of the men went with the warriors, while the other returned home. The warriors then continued up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama, where they engaged in battle and many were killed.

Eventually, the canoes returned to Egulac, and the young man went to his house, made a fire, and told everyone about his experience: \"Behold, I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight.

Suddenly, they heard war cries and thought, \"Perhaps this is a war party.\" They hastened to the shore and hid behind a log. Canoes began to approach, and the hunters heard the sound of paddles.

We're headed up the river to make war on the people.\" One of the young men declined, stating, \"I have no arrows,\" to which the warriors replied, \"Arrows are in the canoe.\" The man was hesitant, citing concerns about his relatives not knowing his whereabouts, but his companion was persuaded to accompany the warriors. The latter\u58eb set off, while the former returned home. The warriors continued up the river to a town on the opposite bank of Kalama, where the locals arrived at the water's edge, and a fierce battle ensued, claiming many lives. In the chaos, a warrior cried, \"Quick, let's go home - that Native American has been struck.\" The young man thought to himself, \"These must be spirits.\" Despite his comrades claiming he had been hit, the man showed no signs of injury. Eventually, the canoes returned to Egulac, and the young man went home, started a fire, and recounted his experiences, including the loss of many lives on both sides. His companions exclaimed, \"You were hit!\" but he remained unaffected. He finished telling his story and then grew silent. It wasn't until sunrise that he fell ill, a black substance emerging from his mouth, and his face contorting in agony. The crowd leapt up, crying in shock, as the young man had succumbed to death.",

His companion, however, joined the warriors, while the other returned home. The warriors proceeded to a town on the opposite side of Kalama, where they engaged the locals in a fierce battle, resulting in numerous casualties. Meanwhile, the reluctant young man began to suspect that the warriors were ghosts when one of them was supposedly injured and didn't feel any pain. Eventually, the canoes returned to Egulac, and the young man shared his tale with others, claiming he had accompanied the \"ghosts\" and that many of their comrades were slain, while many of their attackers were also killed. As he finished his story, he suddenly fell ill, vomited black matter, and died."
