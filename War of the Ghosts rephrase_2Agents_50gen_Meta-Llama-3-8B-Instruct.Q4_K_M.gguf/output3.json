Here is the text: One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

            "One night, two young men from Egulac went to hunt seals by the river, but a sudden fog and calm made them think twice. They heard war cries, and with trepidation, hid behind a log, observing the arrival of five men in a canoe. The men invited them to join their war party, offering to provide arrows, but one of the young men declined, fearing for his safety and the anonymity of his travel. The other, feeling more adventurous, agreed to join the war party. They attacked a town on the opposite side of Kalama, resulting in many casualties on both sides. The young man, claiming he had been shot by the 'ghosts', joined the others when they retreated. Returning to Egulac, he shared his story, but upon sunrise, he died, with something black emerging from his mouth, leaving the people in shock and grief.",
            "One night, two young men from Egulac ventured to the river to hunt seals, but it grew foggy and calm. Suddenly, they heard cries and thought it might be a war party, so they escaped to the shore and hid behind a log. As canoes approached, they spotted five warriors who offered to take them along to wage war on a town across the river. One of the young men declined, citing concerns about his relatives discovering his whereabouts, but his companion agreed to join the warriors. While the warriors went on to fight and many were killed, the companion began to experience strange symptoms after one of the warriors mentioned that someone had been hit. Despite not feeling sick, the companion was led to believe he had been shot. Upon returning to Egulac and recounting the tale, he reported seeing ghosts and many comrades killed. However, upon rising the next morning, he suddenly fell ill, and a dark substance emerged from his mouth, followed by death."
