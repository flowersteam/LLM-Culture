We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

Unexpectedly, they heard war cries, which made them suspect an incoming war party. Panicking, they ran to the shore and hid behind a log. Suddenly, canoes appeared, followed by the sound of paddles. A canoe neared them, containing five men. These men proposed inviting the young men aboard for an upcoming war expedition against distant people. One of the young men objected due to concerns regarding potential harm, while the other accepted. A battle ensued, resulting in numerous casualties at the destination. Hearing of one casualty, the returning warrior was greatly alarmed. He believed them to be spirit entities upon realizing he too had been injured.

Following, canoes approached, and they listened to the sound of paddles and witnessed one drifting towards them. Inside the canoe were five men, who invited them to join their expedition.

Eventually, one man heard one of the warriors cry, 'Let's leave swiftly: that Native American was hit.' He believed they were specters. Although he did not feel sick, he was declared injured. The canoes returned to Egulac, and the young man returned home as well. Later, he created a fire and shared his experience. 'Behold, I accompanied the spirits, and we engaged in battle.
