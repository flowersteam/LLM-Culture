Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

The case of Ireland, separated from Great Britain since the glacial epoch, offers an eloquent argument. Its distinctive fauna, comprised of mammals, reptiles, and land molluscs, has remarkably remained unaltered despite obvious environmental differences.\n\nDespite the absence of change in these species, there are alternative explanations. Perhaps the less intense struggle for existence, caused by fewer competing species, has prevented natural selection from swaying the genetic makeup of these organisms. However, if we consider isolation as a primary driving force, devoid of interlude, it is unfathomable that such a significant shift would not have emerged in countless generations.\n\nThe ostensible lack of transformation in this, as well as in other instances of isolation, raises doubts about the ability of isolation in itself to bring about modification."
