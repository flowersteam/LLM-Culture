Here is the text: One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

            "One night, two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals, but as they arrived, it became foggy and calm. Suddenly, they heard war cries and thought it might be a war party. They quickly escaped to the shore and hid behind a log, as canoes approached. Five men in one canoe came up to them and invited them to join them in making war on the people, offering arrows as needed. One of the young men accepted the invitation, but the other declined, fearing he might be killed and his relatives wouldn't know where he was. However, his friend went along with the warriors. The canoes continued up the river to the other side of Kalama, where a town lay, and the people began to fight. Many were killed, but the young man noticed that the warriors seemed to be immune to harm, as one of them pointedly slipped away, saying, \"Quick, let's go home - that Indian has been hit!\" The young man grew suspicious, thinking the \"warriors\" were, in fact, ghosts. He told everyone at home that he had fought alongside ghosts, and many had been killed, but when he collapsed, a black substance erupted from his mouth, and it dawned on the people that he had actually been hit by an arrow, not shot by magic.",
            "One evening, two young men from Egulac ventured down to the river to hunt seals, but as they arrived, the surroundings became shrouded in fog and an unwonted calm. Suddenly, they heard war cries, and, believing it to be a war party, they hastily retreated to the shore, where they hid behind a log. As canoes emerged and the sound of paddles was heard, they spotted one canoe approaching them, carrying five men. These warriors invited them to join, saying they were bound for a neighboring town to wage war. One of the young men expressed reluctance, citing the absence of his relatives' knowledge of his whereabouts, but his companion was offered a spot in the canoe and accepted. Meanwhile, the other young man returned home. The warriors continued their journey, arriving at the targeted town, where a battle ensued, resulting in many casualties. The young man who had accompanied them then heard one of the warriors exclaim, \"Quick, let us return! That Indian has been struck.\" Convinced that they were ghosts, he realized that he did not feel ill himself, yet the warriors claimed he had been shot. Eventually, the canoes returned to Egulac, and the young man went home, lit a fire, and recounted his experience to everyone. He shared that he had journeyed with the ghosts, that many on both sides had perished, and that they had declared him wounded, but he did not feel sick. After finishing his story, he became quiet, only to die suddenly shortly after sunrise.",

But you,\" he said, turning to the other, \"you can accompany them if you wish.\" So one of the young men agreed, but the other returned home. The warriors proceeded to the opposite side of Kalama, where they encountered a town and launched an attack. Many warriors were killed, but eventually, one of the attackers shouted, \"Quick, let's flee home! That Indian has been hit!\" The young man believed: \"Ah, those must be ghosts, but not sick, just like how they claimed I was hit.\" As the warriors retreated, the young man returned to his home, built a fire, and recounted his unbelievable tale to everyone: \"I traveled with the ghosts, and we fought together. Many of our companions fell, as did many of those who attacked us. They claimed I was wounded, yet I felt no pain.\" After sharing his story, the young man fell silent.

A canoe appeared, and five men paddled up to them. The men in the canoe offered to take the young men along, saying they were headed to a nearby town to make war on the inhabitants. One of the young men refused, fearing he might be killed, but the other agreed to join them. Meanwhile, the other young man returned home, unaware of what was happening. The warriors paddled up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama, where they engaged in a fierce battle that left many dead and injured. As the fighting subsided, one of the warriors exclaimed, \"Quick, let's go home! That Indian's been hit!\" The combined forces retreated to Egulac, and the young man who had gone along with the warriors told everyone about their adventures. Despite reporting that many of his comrades had been killed, he claimed the warriors said he had been hit, but he didn't feel any pain. However, when the sun rose the next day, he suddenly fell ill and died, with a black substance emerging from his mouth.",
