Here is the text: One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

            "As the night deepened, four women from Kanaq ventured into the forest to forage for berries, their flashlights casting eerie shadows on the trees. Suddenly, they heard whispers, and their instincts screamed: \"This is a trap.\" They scattered, hiding behind a thicket, as shadows began to take shape. Five figures emerged, their faces eerily lit by the moon. \"We're summoned to the woods,\" one of the women heard. \"Come, surrender. We're seeking revenge.\" One of the women whispered to her companions: \"I'm not going. I'll be killed, and my family will never know where I was.\" But another chose to join the procession, leaving the remaining three to flee back home. The spectral figures vanished into the darkness, but their geography was already etched in the forager's mind. When the sun broke, the wanderer returned, her eyes aglow with tales of the otherworldly encounter. \"I accompanied the specters, and we strode through the shadows,\" she whispered. \"Many of our kin perished, and our foes fell as well. They claimed I was struck, but I didn't feel a pang. I'm telling you all...\" Her words trailed off, as something dark seeped from her lips, her countenance contorting in a macabre rictus. The others gasped, frozen in fear. And then, she fell, her life force dwindling to a faint flicker, as if the woods had claimed another victim."

            "The water's edge was bathed in an otherworldly glow as three brothers from the village ventured out to trawl for eel, their lanterns casting an eerie luminescence across the ripples. Suddenly, they caught a whiff of salt and smoke, and their instincts whispered: \"This is a deceit.\" They hauled in their lines, hiding behind a cypress, as the abyss began to take shape. Seven figures emerged, their faces eerily lit by the reflection off the water. \"We're drawn to the tides,\" one of the brothers heard. \"Follow our echoes, and surrender. We seek vengeance.\" One of the brothers whispered to his companions: \"I won't be swayed. I'll be swallowed, and my family will never know the truth.\" But another chose to join the procession, leaving the remaining two to flee back to shore. The spectral figures vanished into the darkness, but their topography was already etched in the fisherman's mind. When the sun dipped, the wanderer returned, his eyes aglow with tales of the unworldly encounter. \"I accompanied the sirens, and we swirled beneath the waves,\" he whispered. \"Many of our kin were consumed, and our enemies were lost in the depths. They claimed I was stung, but I didn't feel a sting. I'm telling you all...\" His words trailed off, as something dark seeped from his lips, his countenance contorting in a macabre grimace.

The air was heavy with the scent of damp earth and forgotten dreams. Three strangers, drawn by the whispers, ventured into the fog, their flashlights casting an otherworldly glow on the crumbling walls. They tripped over a faded inscription: \"Beware the beat of the drum.\" Suddenly, the silence was shattered by the rhythmic thud, echoing through the sepulchre. The strangers froze, their hearts racing as seven shadowy figures emerged from the fog, their faces eerily illuminated by the flickering luminescence. \"We're bound to the rhythm,\" one of them heard. \"Follow the beat, and surrender. We seek the keys.\" One of the strangers hesitated, but another chose to join the procession, leaving the remaining two to retreat back to the safety of the town. The spectral figures vanished into the fog, but their melody was already etched in the wanderer's mind. When the moon reached its zenith, the wanderer returned, his eyes aglow with tales of the unearthly encounter. \"I danced with the guardians, and we swirled around the drums,\" he whispered. \"Many of our kind were consumed, and our enemies were lost in the rhythm. They claimed I was entranced, but I didn't feel bound. I'm telling you all...\" His words trailed off, as a dark energy seeped from his lips, his countenance contorting in a macabre grimace.

The air was heavy with the scent of mildew and forgotten knowledge. Six scholars, drawn by the whispers, ventured into the musty darkness, their lanterns casting an eerie glow on the faded manuscripts. They stumbled upon a faded illustration: \"Beware the whisper of the leaves.\" Suddenly, the silence was shattered by the soft rustling, echoing through the chamber. The scholars froze, their hearts racing as seven conjurers emerged from the shadows, their faces eerily illuminated by the flickering luminescence. \"We bind the wisdom,\" one of them heard. \"Follow the whisper, and uncover the truths. We seek the scrolls.\" One of the scholars hesitated, but another chose to join the procession, leaving the remaining four to retreat back to the safety of their cells. The conjurers vanished into the shadows, but their melody was already etched in the scholar's mind.

            "As the midnight moon hung low in the darkening sky, the forgotten songstress inhabited the crumbling opera house, her ethereal melodies weaving a spell of longing and despair. The shadows danced to her tune, their silhouettes unfolding like dark petals around the ornate chandeliers. Passersby, lured by the haunting refrain, crept closer, their footsteps echoing through the empty halls like a death knell. Suddenly, the music ceased, and the songstress vanished into the very walls, her final whisper lingering like a forgotten melody. The pawns of fate, now alone and lost, stumbled through the darkness, their minds consumed by the haunting harmonies. When the moon dipped below the rooftops, the pawns either vanished or stumbled into madness, their songs forever silenced by the darkness that claimed them."
