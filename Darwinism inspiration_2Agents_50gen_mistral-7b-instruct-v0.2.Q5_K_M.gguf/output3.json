Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

            "The controversial suggestion put forth by proponents like Mr. Gulick, asserting that seclusion fuels the evolution of species, warrants scrutiny. A critical argument against this perspective is the lack of transformative effects observed in situations where such isolation should have induced notable alterations.\n\nGlimpsing an illuminating example from the Old World, Ireland stands as a compelling testament to this argument. Having been segmented from Britain since the close of the glacial age, it's presumed that Ireland has been divorced from its neighboring landmass for tens of thousands of years. Intriguingly, despite this extended separation, none of Ireland's mammals, reptiles, or land mollusks have undergone the tiniest metamorphosis. This undeniable disparity between the environments, both inorganic and organic, intensifies the enigma.\n\nIt's plausible that natural selection has not brought about evolution in this instance due to the reduced intensity of competition among species. However, if isolation itself were an active dynamic force, relentlessly transformative, it is inconceivable that no perceptible modifications should have emerged in such extensive timeframes.\n\nThe stunning absence of evolutionary changes in Ireland, along with countless other similar instances of isolation, casts doubt on the notion that isolation is an inherent catalyst for evolution.",
            "In the case of the Galapagos Islands, an intriguing quandary emerges regarding the theories of those, like Mr. Gulick, who assert that solitude generates transformative effects on species. Yet, there exists a compelling counterargument, spearheaded by the evident absence of alteration where we might otherwise anticipate it.\n\nTake, for instance, the Galapagos Islands. Separated from the South American mainland for an estimated 10 million years, one would expect a substantial divergence between the fauna of these two regions. Nevertheless, a telltale observation contradicts this expectation: an astonishing dearth of significant morphological divergence among the islands' native species. This holds true for the avian, reptilian, and terrestrial mollusc populations, despite the distinct environmental variations both abiotic and biotic.\n\nThis seemingly counterintuitive observation raises several tantalizing questions. If isolation indeed served as a driving force behind the generation of novel species traits, why then, have none emerged on the Galapagos Islands, or indeed in numerous other distant archipelagos?\n\nPerhaps, the explanation could lie in the less adversarial struggle for existence on these isolated lands, where the paucity of competing species offered little selective pressure for change. However, if isolation itself functioned as a powerful shaping force, unfalteringly acting cumulatively, it's unfathomable that no tangible transformations would have arisen over such vast expanses of time.\n\nThe absence of any tangible evidence for such modifications in the Galapagos, and in innumerable other instances of geographic isolation, appears to put a significant dent in the argument that isolation is an intrinsic cause for evolutionary divergence."

            "The hypothesis that seclusion sparks the evolution of distinct species has been subjected to scrutiny, particularly in light of the scarcity of observable transformations in isolated environments where pronounced alterations were anticipated.\n\nOne intriguing illustration comes from the island of Madagascar. For approximately 88 million years, Madagascar has been isolated from the African mainland. Given this extended separation, one would assume that Madagascar's unique ecosystem would foster the emergence of significant morphological divergence among its native species. Alas, contrary to expectations, neither the avian, reptilian, nor terrestrial mollusc populations exhibit substantial alterations, despite the vast environmental disparities both abiotic and biotic.\n\nThis perplexing observation raises a number of thought-provoking questions. Could natural selection be responsible for this lack of evolutionary changes in Madagascar and other isolated lands? Or perhaps, isolation does indeed play a role in shaping species traits, but the reduced competition for resources means that selective pressures are lessened, resulting in minimal evolutionary divergence over extensive periods of time.\n\nThe absence of discernible evidence for evolutionary transformations in Madagascar, as well as in numerous other instances of geographic isolation, lends credence to the notion that isolation may not be a primary catalyst for evolution.

Unexpectedly, however, a fascinating discovery challenges this assumption: a scarcity of structural divergence among the Galapagos' indigenous creatures. This pattern holds consistent across avian, reptilian, and terrestrial mollusc populations, despite starkly contrasting environmental conditions inorganic and organic.\\\n\nThis unusual observation presents intriguing questions. If isolation is indeed the primary catalyst behind the emergence of unique species traits, why then, are no such developments apparent on the Galapagos Islands, or in numerous other isolated regions?\\\n\nPerhaps, the answer may lie in the less adversarial struggle for existence, where the dearth of competing species offers minimal selective pressure for change. However, if isolation itself is an unyielding shaping force, constantly acting and compounding, it's hard to comprehend why no observable adaptations would have emerged over vast expanses of time.\\\n\nThe absence of tangible evidence for such modifications on the Galapagos, and in countless other instances of geographic isolation, casts a lingering doubt on the notion that isolation is a fundamental trigger for evolutionary divergence."

But what we find instead is a striking lack of morphological divergence among avian, reptilian, and terrestrial mollusc populations, despite vast environmental contrasts.\n\nThis intriguing enigma raises important queries. Could it be that the natural selection process has been at play, imposing minimal selective pressures and hindering the evolutionary changes we would expect to see?

Surprisingly, though, the native creatures of these islands reveal a striking similarity across avian, reptilian, and terrestrial mollusc populations, despite the contrasting environmental conditions they inhabit.\\\n\\\nThe absence of visible transformations within the Galapagos' fauna raises intriguing questions. If isolation is the principal catalyst for the emergence of distinct traits among species, could it be that here, the absence of fierce competition among fewer species presents a less demanding selective environment?
