Here is the text: One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

Suddenly, they heard war cries and hid themselves behind a log, believing it to be a war party. Soon, canoes filled with warriors appeared, and one canoe approached them. The warriors wanted them to join, stating they were heading upriver to wage war. One of the young men declined the offer, explaining that he had no arrows, had not informed his relatives and might get killed. However, he allowed the other to go with them.\n\nThe warriors then proceeded upriver towards a town across Kalama where they encountered enemies and a fierce battle broke out. Many on both sides lost their lives. During this, one warrior noticed that their new companion was hit and urged a hasty retreat.

            "A dispute took place during a nighttime seal hunt by a river involving two individuals and a group of soldiers in canoes. One of them hesitated to get into a fight due to inadequate weapons and fear of alerting family and risking personal safety. However, the other person chose to proceed with the fight. Once they arrived at Kalama village, a fierce altercation occurred, resulting in injuries and deaths on both sides. Just as the conflict was about to conclude, an opponent noticed that the second individual was hurt and retreated. Despite their assertions of being unhurt, they passed away that night in Egulac, with a peculiar and dark liquid seeping from their mouth."
