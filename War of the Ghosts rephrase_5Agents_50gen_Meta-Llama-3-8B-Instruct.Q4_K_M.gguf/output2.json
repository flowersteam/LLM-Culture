Here is the text: One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

            "One evening, two young men from Egulac descended to the river to hunt seals, only to find themselves enveloped in a foggy and calm atmosphere. As they searched for a suitable place to set up camp, they sensed war cries and thought it might be a war party. They quickly retreated to the shore and hid behind a log. Suddenly, canoes emerged from the fog, and the men heard the sound of paddles and saw one canoe approaching them. The five warriors inside the canoe invited the two young men to join them, claiming they were on a mission to wage war on the people on the other side of Kalama. One of the young men, feeling uneasy, unenthusiastically agreed to accompany the warriors, while the other refused, citing concerns about his relatives not knowing where he had gone.",

They swiftly retreated to the shore and hid behind a log, where they witnessed a canoe bearing five men approaching. The men invited the young men to join them, claiming they were on a mission to wage war against a different tribe. One of the young men, fearing for his life and worried his relatives would not know where he had gone, declined the offer. Meanwhile, his companion agreed to join the warriors. The warriors then paddled upstream to a town on the other side of Kalama, where they engaged in battle, causing many casualties. One of the warriors, however, was injured, and the group hastily retreated. The young man who had initially stayed behind from the expedition returned home, sharing his tale of encountering \"ghosts\" who were fighting alongside the warriors. Despite claiming not to feel any pain, the supposedly \"hit\" young man suddenly fell ill, died, and a dark substance emerged from his mouth.",

The canoes returned to Egulac, and the young man returned home, where he shared his tale with everyone, exaggerating his thrill and adventure. However, shortly after the sun rose, he succumbed to his injuries and died, as something dark emerged from his mouth and his face contorted in agony.

Five men in a canoe approached them, saying they wanted to take them along to make war on a nearby town. One of the young men declined, feeling vulnerable and concerned about his relatives' safety, but the other decided to join the warriors. The battle ensued, and many people were killed before the young man realized that the warriors weren't ordinary humans. Despite this, the warriors claimed he had been hit and brought him back to Egulac, where he relived the events with a sense of quiet awe. However, come sunrise, he suddenly fell ill, and a dark substance emerged from his mouth, accompanied by a distorted expression, ultimately claiming his life.",
            "One night, two young men from Egulac set out to hunt seals by the river. As the fog rolled in, they heard war cries and grew wary. Escaping to the shore, they hid behind a log, observing as canoes approached. Five men claimed they wanted to take the pair along to wage war against the people. One of the young men hesitated due to his lack of arrows, but the other was persuaded to join them. While the warriors paddled up the river to a town across from Kalama, the initial visitor returned home, leaving his friend behind. The battle ensued, with many fatalities on both sides. Later, the young man overheard a warrior urging his comrades to retreat, citing an Indian's injury. Noticing he didn't feel pain, he assumed the attackers were ghosts. However, the warriors insisted he'd been shot, and as they returned to Egulac, the youth went home, built a fire, and shared his tale with the others. Claiming he'd fought alongside spirits, many were killed, and he wasn't injured, though others were. His friends questioned his claims, but as the sun rose, he suddenly collapsed. A dark object emerged from his mouth, and his face contorted in death, sending his companions into a panic."
