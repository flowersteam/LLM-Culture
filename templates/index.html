      This interface provides a comprehensive framework for studying the cultural evolution of linguistic content in populations of Large Language Models (LLMs). It allows organizing LLM agents into networks wherein each agent interacts with neighboring agents by exchanging stories. Each agent can be assigned specific personalities and transmission instructions, serving as prompts for generating new stories from their neighborsâ€™ narratives.
    </p>
    <p>
      To run such experiments, go to the <a class="styled-link" href="simulation">simulation page</a>, initalize a network structure, agent characteristics, and simulate the cultural evolution of texts across generations of agents. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When the simulation is finished, we provide built-in metrics and visualizations to analyze them. You can either analyze <a class="styled-link" href="analysis">one experiment</a> or compare the results <a class="styled-link" href="comparison_analysis">of different experiments</a>.
