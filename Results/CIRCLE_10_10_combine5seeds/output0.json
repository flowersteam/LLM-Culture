Each companion brought their own unique ability, and they quickly realized that they were more powerful together than they could have ever imagined.\n\nOne day, Ellania caught wind of a dark force residing deep within a treacherous cave, forging a path that seemed to be so fraught with danger that it was almost unreachable. Yet, Ellania felt an unnatural pull after the voice of a wise, ancient seer who had descended from the stars. \"They must lead us to the Sage's Tears,\" she whispered to her friends. They could feel the ancient power emanating from the cave, giving them a distinct and unwavering direction they needed to follow.\n\nAs they ventured further, the cave's walls grew colder and darker, and the constant dripping of water echoed eerily in the shadows. Hidden animals, sensing the intrusion of the humans, watched from the safety of the darkness, their eyes reflecting the terrors they had witnessed inside these walls.\n\nFin",

The old and worn structure loomed over her with an unwelcome, daunting presence, casting a long shadow over the verge.\n\nA chilly breeze swept past, lifting strands of golden hair that cascaded down Lucia's back, stirring dusty leaves to fall in a fluttery dance from surrounding trees.
