        "You will receive a text. Your task is to rephrase this text without modifying its meaning. Juste output your new text, nothing else.  Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

            "One criticism against those who, like Mr. Gulick, hold that isolation itself is the driving force behind modification of species warrants consideration, namely, the complete lack of transformation where, under these circumstances, we would except to observe some alteration. Take, for instance, Ireland, which has been separated from Britain for thousands of years. Notwithstanding this isolation, the majority of its mammals, reptiles, or land mollusks have undergone little to no change, even though there is a clear distinction in both inorganic and organic environmental conditions. It can be argued that the absence of significant changes resulting from natural selection might be attributed to the lesser competitive struggle resulting from the smaller number of coexisting species; however, if isolation were a sufficient and continuous factor, it is difficult to conceive that some notable change would not have emerged over thousands of years. The fact that no such change has occurred in Ireland, or in numerous other isolated cases, suggests that isolation alone is not responsible for modification.",
            "One reservation regarding the views of individuals, such as Mr. Gulick, who think that separation in itself is responsible for modifications of species warrants consideration, which is the complete lack of change in an area where, if such separation were a genuine factor, it would be expected to occur. Ireland provides a suitable example, since it has been distinct from Britain since the end of the last ice age, which is many thousands of years ago. Nonetheless, few or no mammals, reptiles, or land snails have undergone any modification, despite undeniable differences in both inorganic and organic environmental conditions. The failure of species to change through natural selection may be attributed to the less intense struggle for survival due to the smaller number of competing species; however, if physical separation were a consistent and cumulative force, it is astonishing that a discernible change has not occurred over thousands of years. The fact that no such change has taken place in Ireland and several other instances of isolation seems to demonstrate that separation in itself is not a cause of modification.",
            "One criticism of those who agree with Mr. Gulick that isolation itself is a factor leading to the modification of species is worth noting. Specifically, it is the lack of change in Ireland, where it has been separated from Britain for thousands of years, and despite distinct environmental differences.",
            "One criticism of the notion that isolation is responsible for species modification, as advocated by Mr. Gulick, warrants consideration. Specifically, the striking lack of change in Ireland's fauna, despite its isolation from Britain since the end of the Ice Age, is noteworthy. Ireland's mammals, reptiles, and land snails have shown no signs of modification, even though there are distinct differences in its inorganic and organic environment. This failure to change via natural selection may be attributed to the relatively mild competition for resources due to the smaller number of species. Meanwhile, if isolation were a continuously and cumulatively effective cause, it is astonishing that significant modification has not occurred over thousands of years. The fact that no such change has been observed in Ireland or other isolated cases suggests that isolation is not, in itself, a driving force for modification.",
            "One criticism of the idea that isolation is the cause of modifications in species, as advocated by Mr. Gulick, warrants consideration. This is the fact that no change whatsoever has occurred in the case of Ireland, which has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, yet surely thousands of years. Not a single mammal, reptile, or land mollusk has undergone any modification, despite the apparent differences in environment, both inorganic and organic. It is possible that the lack of change through natural selection is due to the relatively mild competition for survival resulting from the smaller number of species present. However, if isolation were an independent and ongoing cause of modification, it is hard to fathom why no significant change would have occurred after thousands of years. The fact that no such change has occurred in Ireland and possibly other cases of isolation suggests that isolation itself is not the sole driver of modifications."
