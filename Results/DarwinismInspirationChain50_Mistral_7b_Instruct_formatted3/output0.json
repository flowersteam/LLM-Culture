Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

            "Observing the fauna of Ireland, an intriguing paradox emerges. Despite its long-term separation from Britain, marked by the end of the glacial epoch, little to no modifications have been observed in its mammals, reptiles, or land mollusks. In contrast to places like the Galapagos, where isolation birthed distinctive species, Ireland presents a puzzle. This apparent lack of evolution, especially considering the distinct environmental differences, challenges those, like Mr. Gulick, who posit that isolation drives modification. The absence of change in this case may imply less severe competition or a unique stabilizing factor at play, yet the enduring question remains: How is it that a noticeable difference has not materialized over countless years in these isolated ecosystems? Such instances galvanize the debate surrounding the true impact of isolation on the evolutionary process."

Though geographically separated from Great Britain through the passage of the last ice age, the fauna reveals scarcely any significant divergences among its mammals, reptiles, and terrestrial mollusks. An enigma contrasts the expected uniqueness of species found in islands like the Galapagos, where isolation sparks distinct evolutionary paths. However, the persisting query persists: Why, in these secluded ecosystems, has transformation not materialized despite the observable ecological disparities? Moreover, the dearth of changes could allude to a lessened competition, or perhaps, the presence of an elusive factor bolstering stability within these ecosytems. Yet, the conundrum poses a captivating dilemma for those who argue that isolation fuels evolutionary diversity, provoking further investigation into this intriguing phenomenon."

Stopping just a short distance from Australia through the geological trenches of time, the fauna displays minimal distinctions among its birds, amphibians, and insects. In contrast to the anticipation of unique species observed in archipelagos such as the Galapagos, where isolation drives extraordinary evolutionary paths, the question arises: Why, in these isolated ecosystems, haven't new species emerged despite the significant ecological contrasts? Possibly, the scarcity of evolutionary novelty could be attributed to reduced competition or perhaps, the presence of a mysterious factor fortifying stability within these ecosystems.
