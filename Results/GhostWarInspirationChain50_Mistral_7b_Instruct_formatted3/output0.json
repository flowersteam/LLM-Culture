Here is the text: One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

            "Two brothers from the village of Wakanda ventured out one night to hunt by the river's edge. Suddenly, the serene scene was disrupted by a dense fog and an eerie stillness. Without warning, they heard war cries echoing in the distance and instinctively sought refuge behind a large rock. As canoes emerged, revelaing five mysterious figures, one of the brothers hesitated, \"I have no weapons.\" The strangers responded, \"Weapons are in the canoe. Join us on our quest for victory against our enemies.\"\n\nDriven by fear for his own safety and concern for his loved ones' wellbeing, the first brother declined the offer and decided to remain hidden. However, the second brother bravely accepted the invitation and rode alongside the warriors up the river.\n\nAs they approached an enemy settlement along the banks of Kalama, chaos ensued: the clash of war cries and weapons filled the air. The fierce battle ended abruptly when one of the warriors was struck down. Blindsided, the surviving brother was terrified. \"These must be spirits,\" he thought, striking fear into the hearts of those gathered around the campfire.\n\nParalyzed yet unaffected by the injury, the brother shared the tale of their otherworldly encounter. Many lives were senselessly lost on both sides. Astonished by the account, his village gathered around, listening intently, eager for every detail. His bravery was questioned and his return was celebrated.\n\nBut as the sun crept over the horizon, the brother's health began to falter. A dark substance oozed from his mouth as his countenance twisted in unspeakable agony. Unable to bear witness to this dramatic transformation, the villagers cried out in terror and despair. The brother, now consumed by the spirits, slipped from this world."

Unforeseen, battle cries erupted in the distance, prompting the men to seek cover behind a colossal tree. As separate vessels appeared, revealing five enigmatic figures, one of the friends hesitated, \"I lack protective arms.\" The enigmatic strangers replied, \"Arms are within the boats. Join us on our crusade for triumph against our adversaries.\"\n\nBewildered by fear for his own survival and thoughts of his loved ones' safety, the first friend hesitated and opted to remain hidden. But the courageous second friend boldly accepted the proposition, embarking alongside the warriors up the river.\n\nNear the enemy settlement nestled along the Kalbana banks, pandemonium erupted: the clash of war cries and weapons rent the air asunder. The brutal battle came to an abrupt end, leaving the surviving brother reeling in shock. \"These beings must be ethereal beings,\" he decided, instilling a sense of dread in all around the campfire.\n\nParalyzed yet unharmed by the injury, the brother recounted their otherworldly encounter. Countless lives were senselessly claimed on both sides of the conflict. The account left the community in awe, as they gathered around to hear every detail.

A dark substance seeped from his lips as his visage contorted in unfathomable agony. Unable to watch this harrowing transformation, the villagers gasped, gripped by terror and dismay.

A serene atmosphere enveloped them until a disconcerting stillness was shattered by the sudden sound of horns blaring in the nearby woodlands. The friends sought refuge behind the towering trunk of an ancient oak. Unforeseen specters of figments materialized, unveiling seven enigmatic entities. One of the friends hesitated, \"I lack a shield,\" he exclaimed. The otherworldly entities responded, \"Protection lies within the boats. Join us in our quest to vanquish our foes.\"\n\nelandered by fear for his own life and consideration for his loved ones' welfare, the first friend hesitated and chose to remain concealed. Yet the second friend, filled with valiance, embraced the offer and embarked with the enigmatic warriors upriver.\n\nReaching the enemy encampment hidden along the Belsaya banks, chaos erupted: fierce battle cries and clashing weapons fractured the air. The harsh battle came to a sudden end, leaving the surviving brother petrified. \"These entities must be divine entities,\" he surmised, creating unease in all around the campfire.\n\nFrozen yet unhurt, the brother recounted their encounter in a spacious tent, as the villagers listened intently, stunned by the surreal tale. Ageless lifestyles were mercilessly extinguished on both sides of the battlefield. The story left the community transfixed, as they marveled at every detail. His heroic actions were questioned, yet his miraculous return was celebrated.\n\nHowever, as dawn illuminated the horizon, the brother's wellbeing deteriorated. An ominous substance oozed from his mouth as his face twisted in incomprehensible torment.

            "Two siblings from the secluded hamlet of Eldern rose for an evening promenade by the luminous lakeshore. The tranquility of their surroundings was disrupted when jarring horns echoed through the neighboring forest. They dashed behind the enormous boughs of an ancient elm for cover. Fantastical apparitions arose, unveiling eleven elusive entities. The first sibling trembled, \"I have no armor,\" he acknowledged. The enigmatic beings retorted, \"Security exists in the vessels. Join us on our crusade against our adversaries.\"\n\n2. Fear gripped the first sibling for his existence and the safety of his kinfolks. Yet the second sibling, emboldened by courage, acknowledged the invitation and sailed with the elusive champions upstream.\n\n3. Arriving at the concealed enemy outpost on the Belsaya coastline, pandemonium ensued: shrieks of war and the whirring of weapons consumed the atmosphere. The lethal battle ended in an instant, leaving the triumphant brother in terror. \"These creatures must be celestial beings,\" he pondered, instilling a shudder of reverence around the campfire.\n\n4. Paralyzed but uninjured, the brother narrated their experience within the expansive confines of a grand tent. The villagers hung on every word, stupefied by the bizarre account. The merciless termination of timeless lives blanketed the battlefield. The tale left the populace spellbound, as they absorbed every intricate detail. His brave actions were debated, yet his extraordinary return was commemorated.\n\n5. As dawn painted the skyline, the brother's health waned. A morbid liquid leaked from his lips as his visage contorted in confusion and agony. Overcome by terror, the onlookers gaped, rendering him little solace. The brother, now under the care of the celestial entities, yielded to his fate."
