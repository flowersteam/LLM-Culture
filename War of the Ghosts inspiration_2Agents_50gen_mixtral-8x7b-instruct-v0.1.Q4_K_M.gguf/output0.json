Here is the text: One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

            "One evening, two friends from the village of Atqasuk decided to venture to the nearby river to catch some salmon. As they sat on the riverbank, the weather shifted, enveloping them in a dense fog and stillness. Suddenly, they heard loud, aggressive shouting in the distance. Puzzled and alarmed, one of them whispered, \"Could this be a rival group of fishermen?\" Fearful of a potential conflict, they quickly hid behind a large boulder.\n\nA moment later, a flotilla of canoes emerged from the fog, their paddles slicing through the water, growing louder and louder. In one of the canoes, five figures were visible. With a menacing tone, they called out, \"We could use some extra hands. Join us, and we'll head upstream to confront our enemies.\"\n\nSeemingly unfazed, one of the friends responded, \"I don't have a harpoon,\" to which the reply came, \"There are weapons in the canoe. You can use one of ours.\" The other friend hesitated, considering the possible consequences. \"I can't go with you. If I'm injured or worse, my family won't know what's happened to me. However, you are welcome to go,\" he said, reluctantly encouraging his companion.\n\nAgreeing to the arrangement, the remaining friend joined the strangers as they proceeded upriver. They soon arrived at a village, where a battle ensued, leaving many casualties on both sides. During the chaos, the young man heard one of the strangers exclaim, \"Hurry, we need to leave\u2014that villager has wounded one of us!\"\n\nPanic surged through him as he realized, \"These must be the spirits of the departed, returned to seek vengeance.\" Despite feeling unharmed, they told him he'd been struck and he began to fear the worst.\n\nUpon returning to Atqasuk, the warrior-like spirits left him on the riverbank, where he returned to his home, exhausted and frightened by his ordeal. He built a fire, struggling to find the words to share his tale with his fellow villagers. \"Listen, I've returned from accompanying the spirits in battle against our foes. Countless lives were lost in the fighting, and yet I remain unscathed, or so",

As they sat in the silence, they heard distant, ominous shouting. Puzzled, one of the men whispered, \"Could this be a war party?\" Fearful, they paddled to the shore, hiding behind a boulder.\n\nSoon, they saw the glow of torches approaching in canoes. They counted five figures, who called out, \"We welcome you to join us. We journey upriver to engage in battle and seek vengeance on our enemies.\" One of the friends hesitated, saying, \"I don't have a weapon.\"\n\nThe visitors reassured him, stating, \"We have weapons in our canoe. You are safe with us.\" But, fearing for his life, the first friend refused to go. Turning to the other, he said, \"Go with them if you wish, but I prefer to return to the safety of the village.\" The second friend joined the warriors as they journeyed upriver toward a town across the river from the village of Luna.\n\nThe two forces clashed at the water's edge, and a fierce battle ensued, with casualties on both sides. During the chaos, however, the second friend heard one of the warriors say, \"Let us go! One of them has been struck!\" Fearful, he wondered, \"Are they ghosts?\" Despite feeling unharmed, his companions in the canoe murmured, \"He's been hit!\"\n\nAs they approached Vespers, he exited the canoe, hurrying to his dwelling to tell his story by firelight. The villagers gasped as he spoke, describing the brutal battle and those who had supposedly been struck down. The storyteller suddenly convulsed and fell, a black substance escaping from his mouth. In a panic, the people cried out. Alas, he died as day broke, leaving the attendees in hushed despair."
