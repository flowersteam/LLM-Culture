Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

It is the stark absence of change in environments where, if isolation were a decisive factor, we would expect to see it. A prime example is Ireland, which has been geographically isolated from Britain since the end of the last ice age, a period spanning thousands of years. Notably, Ireland's mammals, reptiles, and terrestrial mollusks have undergone virtually no evolutionary changes, despite distinct differences in its inorganic and organic environments. While it is possible that the lesser competitive struggle for survival in Ireland has prevented significant change through natural selection, the lack of change over such a long period suggests that isolation alone is not sufficient to trigger modification of species.\tThis absence of change in Ireland and similar cases of isolation serves as strong evidence that isolation is not an inherent driver of species modification."
