Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

Ireland presents an ideal example for examination, as it has been isolated from Britain since the end of the glacial period, a timespan of many thousands of years. However, none of its mammals, reptiles, or land mollusks have experienced even the slightest alteration. This remains true despite the distinct differences in both inorganic and organic environments. While it's possible that changes haven't occurred due to a less intense struggle for existence caused by fewer competing species, it's still surprising that no changes have occurred given the continuous and cumulative effects of isolation over thousands of years.
