Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

The argument lies in the conspicuous lack of change in environments where, if isolation were indeed a contributing factor, we would anticipate witnessing such alterations. An exemplary instance of this can be observed in Ireland, which has been disconnected from Britain since the conclusion of the glacial era, a considerable time span. Despite this, there is an almost negligible difference in the mammals, reptiles, and land mollusks when compared to their British counterparts, even though the environmental conditions, both organic and inorganic, distinctly vary. The absence of changes cannot be attributed to natural selection faced by a lesser struggle for existence due to fewer competing species.

            "##TEXT## The concept proposed by Gulick, implying that the spatial organization of territories influences the emergence of specific species, is fascinating. The root of this notion lies in the conspicuous absence of transitional forms in regions where, if isolation was the dominant force, one would anticipate finding them. For instance, Ireland, which has been detached from Britain since the conclusion of the ice age, exhibits remarkable ecological disparities and uncanny resemblances in terrestrial animals, reptiles, and land snails with Britain. This restricted diversity cannot be ascribed to natural selection due to diminished competition. If isolation was a potent and enduring factor, considerable variations would probably emerge over extended periods. Nevertheless, the non-appearance of these shifts, not only in this case but in numerous other isolated instances, implies that isolation might not be the principal evolutionary mechanism. ##TEXTEND##"

            "##TEXT## The idea suggested by Gulick, which posits that the spatial arrangement of territories impacts the development of specific species, is intriguing. The basis of this idea stems from the notable absence of transitional forms in regions where, if isolation was the primary force, one would expect to find them. For example, Ireland, which has been separated from Britain since the end of the ice age, displays significant ecological differences and striking similarities in terrestrial animals, reptiles, and land snails with Britain. This limited diversity cannot be attributed to natural selection resulting from reduced competition. If isolation was a powerful and persistent factor, substantial variations would likely emerge over long periods. However, the lack of these changes, not only in this case but in numerous other isolated instances, suggests that isolation might not be the main evolutionary mechanism. ##TEXTEND##"
