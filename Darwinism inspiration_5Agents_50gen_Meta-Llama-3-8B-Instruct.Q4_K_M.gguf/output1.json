Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

The consistency in their physical appearance and genetic makeup, despite the drastic environmental adaptations of their urban surroundings, raises questions about the efficacy of urbanization as a force driving evolutionary change.",

A curious instance of this disparity arises when we examine the \"independent\" works of anonymous internet artists, shielded from constraints of traditional realms yet still revealing few distinguishing characteristics. Is the reason for this homogenous landscape not the reduced pressure from peer review and competition, but rather, the same influx of stimuli we humans receive, muting the natural inclination to innovation?

            "In the realm of digital languages, a similar conundrum has arisen. Proponents of isolationist coding, like Ms. Welles, claim that the sole act of coding in isolation leads to inevitable software modifications. However, a close examination of this premise reveals a glaring paradox. In the vast expanse of coding history, we have cases where developers have worked in isolation for extended periods, yet their programming languages and frameworks have remained largely unchanged.",

The Kuiper Belt has been a distinct and isolated region for billions of years, yet the physical characteristics of its objects have remained surprisingly consistent."
