Here is the text: One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

            "One autumn morning, two elderly women from Aravak went up the mountain to gather berries and while they were there, a thick mist enveloped the trees. Then they heard whispers, and they thought: \"Maybe this is a group of spirits.\" They retreated to the base of a pine, and hid behind its trunk. Now, a procession of white-clad figures emerged from the mist, and they heard the soft rustling of fabric, and saw one figure advancing towards them. There were five spirits, and they said: \"What do you think? We wish to take you with us. We are going to the peak to perform a ritual.\" One of the elderly women said, \"I have no sacred texts.\" \"The texts are in our midst,\" they said. \"I will not join you. I might be possessed. My family does not know where I have gone. But you,\" she said, turning to the other, \"may go with them.\" So one of the elderly women went, but the other returned home. And the spirits went on up the mountain to a clearing on the other side. The others came forth, and they began to chant, and many were entranced. But presently one of the elderly women heard one of the spirits say, \"Quick, let us return: that person has been taken.\" Now she thought: \"Oh, they are the guardians of the mountain.\" She did not feel relaxed, but they said she had been transported. So the procession went back to Aravak and the elderly woman went ashore to her hut and made a fire. And she told everybody and said: \"Behold I accompanied the guardians, and we went to the peak. Many of our kind were entranced, and many of those who joined us were entranced. They said I was transported, and I did not feel changed.\" She told it all, and then she became quiet. When the sun rose high, she fell down. Something ethereal came out of her mouth. Her face became serene. The people gathered around and whispered. She was gone.",
            "In the sweltering summer evening, three women from the village of Kutarawa ventured into the dense jungle to gather rare herbs. As they delved deeper into the undergrowth, the air grew thick with mist and the silence was broken by whispers. They exchanged nervous glances, unsure if the strange murmurs were the calls of nocturnal creatures or something more ominous. Suddenly, a faint rustling sound echoed through the foliage, sending the women into a frenzy of panic. Frantically, they scrambled to escape, but their path was blocked by a dense thicket. That's when they spotted three figures emerging from the depths of the jungle, their faces masked by shadows. \"Come with us,\" the trio beckoned, their tone crooning with an unearthly allure. And so, two of the women were drawn towards the unknown, while the third managed to slip away unnoticed."
