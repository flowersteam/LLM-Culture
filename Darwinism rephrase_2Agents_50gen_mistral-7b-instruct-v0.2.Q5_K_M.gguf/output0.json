Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

            "The argument against the belief of those, including Mr. Gulick, that seclusion leads to species transformation merits consideration. Specifically, the lack of any discernible alterations in species, despite presumed prolonged isolation, is a notable point.\n\nIreland serves as an exemplary scenario for examination, as it has been independent from Britain since the conclusion of the glacial period, with an estimated time frame of tens of thousands of years. However, not a single mammal, reptile, or terrestrial mollusk has displayed the slightest evolution, despite marked differences in the abiotic and biotic surroundings.\n\nThe absence of transformations triggered by natural selection might be attributed to less formidable contention for existence among a reduced number of rivaling species. Yet, considering isolation as a potent agent, if it were continually and additively inducing modification, a noticeable shift would have emerged within this vast timeframe.\n\nThe failure to document any noteworthy evolutionary adaptation in Ireland, as well as numerous other comparable instances of separation, casts doubt on the notion that seclusion represents the primary cause of species modification.",
            "The argument against the belief of those, including Mr. Gulick, that seclusion is a causative factor for species modifications merits consideration. A significant point is the complete lack of transformation in instances where, assuming seclusion to be a valid cause, we would anticipate finding it. An illustrative example can be found in Ireland, where the country has been distinct from Britain since the conclusion of the glacial era, a timeframe likely exceeding ten thousand years. Nevertheless, almost none of its mammals, reptiles, or terrestrial mollusks have experienced any alteration, striking as it is that the environments inorganic and organic differ noticeably.\n\nIf transformations have not taken place through natural selection, this might be attributed to the reduced competition among species. However, considering seclusion an active catalyst for modifications, it's unfathomable that no noteworthy change would have occurred in such extended timeframes. The absence of significant transformation in cases like this, and in numerous other contexts of seclusion, raises serious doubts about its role as a modifying agent."

It has been separate from Britain since the end of the glacial era, approximately ten thousand years or more. Yet, none of its mammals, reptiles, or terrestrial mollusks have undergone any evolution, despite substantial variations in their inorganic and organic environments.\n\nThe absence of transformations due to natural selection might be attributed to weaker competition among a smaller number of species.

Despite significant differences in abiotic and biotic environments, no mammal, reptile, or terrestrial mollusk has evolved noticeably.\n\nIf modifications have not resulted from natural selection, they could be due to less intense competition among species during seclusion.
