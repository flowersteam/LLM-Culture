Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

Ireland has provided a perfect example of this situation, having been isolated from Britain since the end of the glacial period - a span of many thousands of years. Despite the distinct differences in its organic and inorganic environments, there has been minimal to no change observed in the majority of its mammals, reptiles, and land mollusks.\n\nThe idea that these organisms haven't changed due to natural selection may be attributed to the less intense competition among a smaller number of species. However, if isolation were indeed a primary cause acting persistently and cumulatively, it would be surprising that no noticeable changes occurred over the course of thousands of years. Given that no such changes have taken place, both in this case and in numerous other instances of isolation, it seems plausible that isolation may not be an independent cause of modification."
