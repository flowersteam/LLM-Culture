Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

Notably, very few of its mammals, reptiles, or terrestrial mollusks have undergone any measurable alteration, despite apparent environmental differences inorganic and organic.\n\n2. Although natural selection may not have been the culprit for the absence of change in these instances, the argument that isolation is ineffective in producing modifications is fortified by the lack of transformation in various isolation cases.

Nonetheless, if isolation was an efficacious cause acting cumulatively over thousands of years, it isHardly conceivable that no definite modification would have ensued.

Strikingly, a paucity of its mammals, reptiles, or terrestrial shelled animals have experienced any detectable mutation, noteworthy disparities in their environments notwithstanding.\n\n2. Natural selection may not have been responsible for the absence of change in these instances, but the argument that seclusion fails to foster modifications is strengthened by the absence of metamorphosis in assorted seclusion situations. The limited competition among species in Ireland, leading to reduced strife for existence, may have inhibited modifications. Nevertheless, if seclusion served as an effective catalyst acting progressively over millennia, it is scarcely plausible that no significant transformation would have transpired.

The assumption that natural selection cannot explain the limited number of modifications observed in these instances should be questioned. Proposed explanations propose that Irish species may have suppressed adaptations and experienced reduced selective pressure due to intense competition. Nevertheless, Ireland's prolonged separation from other territories raises doubts over whether the scarcity of significant adaptations is the sole catalyst propelling evolution. Conversely, the meager evidence supporting remarkable adaptations in Ireland versus comparable situations of isolation implies that seclusion might not be the sole influencer of evolutionary growth."

            "The concept of distinct species developing unique traits independently, even in isolated areas, merits additional investigation in light of recent discoveries of unforeseen mutations in seemingly distinct locales. A compelling illustration of this phenomenon can be found in the geological separation of Ireland from Britain during the Ice Age, which did not prevent the slightest evolutionary advancements in its mammals, reptiles, and land snails, in spite of significant ecological divergence.\n\n2. The belief that natural selection cannot account for the restricted number of modifications noted in these situations needs reevaluation. Suggested explanations suggest that Irish species may have suppressed adaptations and encountered diminished selective pressure due to heightened competition. However, Ireland's prolonged detachment from other territories raises suspicion over whether the scarcity of substantial adaptations is the sole driver of evolutionary progression. On the contrary, the limited evidence supporting exceptional adaptations in Ireland versus analogous situations of seclusion implies that isolation might not be the only factor guiding evolutionary development."

            "The idea that distinct species independently acquire unique characteristics, including in isolated regions, warrants further exploration given recent unearthed mutations in seemingly disparate locales. An intriguing manifestation of this process is visible in the geological rift between Ireland and Britain throughout the Ice Age, which failed to impede the slightest evolutionary enhancements in their mammals, reptiles, and land snails, despite notable ecological diversity.\n\n2. [\nThe notion that natural selection falls short in explaining the limited modifications observed in these circumstances deserves reconsideration. Proposed explanations propose that Irish species may have suppressed adaptations and confronted weakened selective forces due to heightened rivalry. Nevertheless, Ireland's extended time apart from other territories prompts skepticism regarding whether the lack of substantial adaptations serves as the sole catalyst for evolutionary advancement. Conversely, the meager evidence bolstering exceptional adaptations in Ireland versus comparable situations of seclusion implies that isolation might not be the sole element steering evolutionary progression."
