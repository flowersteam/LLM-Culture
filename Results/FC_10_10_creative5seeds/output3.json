For Melissa, today marked the perfect opportunity to explore deeper into the town's past, something she had wanted to do for quite a while. Among the many attractions, there stood a peculiar towering building known as the Stargazer's Observatory, which had always captured her curiosity.\n\nThe Stargazer's Observatory was built nearly a century ago, a place where amateur astronomers and casual observers could gather to marvel at the beauty of the cosmos through powerful telescopes.

She understood Balthasar's warning about treasure not being about physical possessions. Thus, she skipped away, whispering, \"Thank you, Balthasar,\" to the golden dragon as she departed.
