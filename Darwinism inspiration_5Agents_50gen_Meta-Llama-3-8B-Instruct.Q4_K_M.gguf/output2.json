Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

            "The intriguing case of the Galapagos Islands' bird species, known for their remarkable diversity, offers a compelling counterexample to the idea that geographical isolation alone can lead to speciation. For over a decade, the archipelago has been separated from the mainland, yet the majority of its bird populations have remained unchanged. This lack of variation is all the more striking considering the significant differences in environment, from the lush forests to the arid atolls.",

            "The claim that a new language is more effective at conveying complex ideas is often met with skepticism, citing the absence of significant changes in linguistic structures over centuries in isolated communities. In Tibet, for instance, a distinct language has been preserved for millennia, yet its grammar and vocabulary have remained remarkably consistent despite geological and cultural upheavals. This lack of evolution in language is perplexing, as one would expect significant alterations in response to environmental pressures. The rarity of linguistic innovation in isolated societies suggests that the notion of isolation leading to language change is an oversimplification.",
            "The United States and Mexico provide an intriguing example of geographical isolation, separating since the end of the Pleistocene era. One would expect, based on the theory of speciation through isolation, that distinct changes would have occurred in their endemic species. However, a thorough examination of their faunal records reveals striking stability, with neither country experiencing significant modifications in their respective mammalian, avian, or marine populations. This phenomenon challenges the notion that geographical isolation alone is a driving force behind speciation, suggesting that other factors, such as competition, climate, and dispersal, play a far more crucial role in shaping the diversity of life.",

Is it possible that the rigid conventions of these artisan communities are not a testament to stagnation, but rather a reflection of their unique aptitude for innovation within the constraints of their traditional practices? A closer examination of the intricate patterns and techniques employed by these craftspeople reveals a depth of understanding that may not be immediately apparent to the untrained eye. Nonetheless, it is imperative to inquire whether the notion that traditional craftsmanship is an art in decline is subject to the same scrutiny as other claims of artistic obsolescence, and delve into the evidence that might support or challenge such a notion.\"",

The notion that online group formation and evolution are contingent on factors such as algorithmic filtration and cultural osmosis, rather than physical isolation, may challenge the prevailing understanding of community development. A small but telling example is the persistence of dedicated forums for specific hobbies, remaining remarkably consistent in their modus operandi and user demographics despite numerous amalgamations and shifts in the virtual landscape. This resilience in the face of technological and demographic transformations serves as a stark reminder that while information has become increasingly fluid, social structures and affiliations remain surprisingly resilient.\""
