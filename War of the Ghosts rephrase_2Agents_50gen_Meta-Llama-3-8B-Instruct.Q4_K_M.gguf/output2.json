Here is the text: One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

            "One evening, two young men from Egulac ventured down to the river to catch seals, but as they arrived, a thick fog rolled in and the water became eerily calm. Suddenly, they heard war cries and thought they might be the target of an attack. They scrambled to the shore and hid behind a log, watching as canoes paddled closer. Five warriors disembarked and invited the young men to join them, explaining they were on a mission to wage war on the people of another town upstream. One of the young men refused, citing concerns about being killed and his family not knowing where he'd gone, but his companion decided to join the warriors. The group continued upriver to the enemy's town, where a fierce battle ensued, resulting in many casualties. As the warriors prepared to retreat, one of them exclaimed, \"Quick, let's go home \u2013 that Indian has been hit!\" The accompanying young man thought the warriors were certifiably demonic, given that they claimed he'd been struck despite showing no signs of illness. Upon their return to Egulac, the young man shared his astonishing tale, claiming he'd fought alongside \"ghosts\" and seen many of his comrades and foes fall. As he finished speaking, a strange black substance emerged from his mouth, his face contorted in agony, and he collapsed to the ground, having died before the sun rose.",
            "One night, two young men from Egulac ventured to the river to hunt seals, but as they arrived, a thick fog rolled in, accompanied by an eerie silence. Suddenly, they were startled by war cries, and they hypothesized it might be a war party. The pair escaped to the shore and hid behind a log, as canoes approached. Five men in one canoe announced their intention to abduct the young men, claiming they were headed to a town on the opposite side of Kalama to wage war. However, one of the men declined the offer, citing the risk of being killed and not being able to communicate with his relatives. His companion, undeterred, joined the warriors. Meanwhile, the young man who refused to participate returned home."

            "One evening, two young men from Egulac went to the river to hunt, but when they arrived, a thick, heavy mist surrounded the area, and an oppressive stillness filled the air. The sudden sound of war cries startled them, and they quickly scrambled to the shore, hiding behind a log to watch as the canoes paddled closer. Five warriors got out of the canoes, announcing their intention to take the young men with them, claiming they were headed to a town on the opposite side of Kalama to wage war. One of the young men was hesitant, citing the risk of being killed and the difficulty of communicating with his relatives, but his companion joined the warriors, while the other returned home."
