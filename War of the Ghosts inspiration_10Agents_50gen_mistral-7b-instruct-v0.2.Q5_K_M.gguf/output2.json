Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

Unexpectedly, the tranquil night was disrupted by a sudden hush, followed by terrifying war cries. The young men, fearing for their lives, hastily made their way to the shore and concealed themselves behind a large boulder. A fleet of canoes appeared, propelled by the rhythmic sound of paddles. Six imposing figures emerged from the vessels, demanding their allegiance for an impending war.\n\nDesperate to protect his family's welfare, one warrior admitted, \"I have exhausted my ammunition.\" The war party responded, \"Fear not, your arrows are amongst our supplies. Depart if you wish, but your companion may join us.\" Riddled with doubt, one of the men hesitated, contemplating the destructive path they were about to embark upon. In the end, he reluctantly selected his brother in arms, leaving him to return to their village.\n\nAs the warriors continued their trek upriver toward the fortified Ahuitchi settlement, the village people gathered on the shore for the impending battle. The cacophony of war cries filled the air, and many lives were sacrificed on both sides. It was then that the surrendering warrior heard an ominous cry from the enemy, \"Swiftly, let us depart, the other warrior has been struck down!\"\n\nIn an instant, he knew the truth - the enemy were spirits. Unharmed but bewildered, he breathed a sigh of relief and made his way back to his people. Upon his arrival, he gathered them around the fire and recounted the incredible events that had transpired on the battlefield that night. \"I have returned from the realm of the spirits,\" he said, \"They took me on a war excursion, and, as I bore witness, many lives were claimed.\" He continued, unsure if his words would be believed by the gathered village elders and kin.\n\nAnd as the sun rose the next day, the beating heart of the once-tragic warrior stilled. Convinced that he had consumed the spirit world's essence, and now fused with its dark powers, the people recoiled fearfully. He stiffened, with nothing but a sublime",

The evening grew still, and a thick layer of mist enveloped the land, pausing the world in a tranquil hush. All of a sudden, they noticed the eerie sound of battle cries in the distance, sending chills down their spines. With heart racing, they swiftly escaped to the sandy shore, concealing themselves behind the safety of a large driftwood log. Silhouettes of canoes began to appear through the fog, propelled by the rhythmic beating of paddles. Seven fierce warriors inhabited their boat, announcing their intentions. \"Join us,\" they called out. \"We are heading upstream to wage war against our enemies.\" One brother hesitated, \"Alas, I am left unprepared. I carry no ammunition.\" The warriors responded, \"Fret not, arrows are on board the canoe. Willingly come with us.\" With a heavy heart, one brother reluctantly agreed, while the other chose to return home, unwilling to leave behind his loved ones.

As they stood there, the serene night was suddenly engulfed in an ethereal fog, accompanied by an eerie stillness. Suddenly, they heard bloodcurdling war cries in the distance, and their hearts raced with fear.\n\nInstinctively, they fled to the safety of the shore and hid behind a towering log.
