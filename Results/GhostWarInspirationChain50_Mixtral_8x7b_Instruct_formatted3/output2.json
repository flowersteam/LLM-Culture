Here is the text: One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

            "In the stillness of the night, two brothers from the village of Ezuka decided to venture to the riverbank to set traps for the elusive marlin. Suddenly, the calmness was broken by the sound of distant drumming, causing the brothers to freeze. \"Perhaps it's a celebration,\" one brother suggested, but the other was not convinced. The rhythm of the drums grew louder as the faint glow of torches appeared through the thick fog. The brothers knew they had to hide and quickly found refuge behind a large boulder.\n\nA flotilla of boats emerged from the mist, their oars slicing through the water in unison. In one of the boats, five figures, clad in leaves and feathers, whispered to each other. \"Friends, we have traveled far and seek your assistance,\" one of them called out. \"Join us as we row to the neighboring village to exchange gifts and share stories.\"\n\nThe younger brother hesitated. \"I don't have anything to offer. I didn't bring any gifts.\" Sensing his hesitation, the visitors assured him, \"Worry not, for we carry gifts aplenty. You will be welcomed with open arms.\"\n\nDespite his brother's unease, the elder agreed to join the visitors on their journey. As the flotilla departed, the remaining brother returns home, uneasy about the outcome of this spontaneous encounter.\n\nHours passed, and the younger brother participated in a night of feasting and storytelling. Yet, as dawn approached, he noticed something peculiar. One of the visitors, seemingly healthy only moments earlier, suddenly clutched his chest and collapsed. The celebratory atmosphere turned somber, and the brothers watched in horror as the stranger's face contorted, and black liquid poured from his mouth. The young man quickly rowed back to his village, filled with dread.\n\nUpon arriving home, he recounted the tale to his fellow villagers, his words tripping over themselves as he struggled to explain the inexplicable. As he finished his harrowing account, he stumbled, falling to the ground. Those surrounding him leapt back in terror as a dark pool expanded beneath him, claiming another soul."

            "In the hush of twilight, two siblings from the hamlet of Elderglen set off to the edge of the forest with hopes of catching a glimpse of the rare white stag. The quiet serenity was disrupted by the faint sound of pipes in the distance, prompting the duo to pause. \"Maybe it's a festival,\" one sibling offered, but the other remained unconvinced. The melody of the pipes grew louder, and through the dense trees appeared a procession of lights. The siblings knew they needed to find cover and quickly hid behind a massive oak.\n\nA line of travelers, adorned in flowers and vines, emerged from the shadows. In the midst of them, five figures, dressed in foliage and petals, murmured amongst themselves. \"Friends, we have journeyed far and seek your companionship,\" one of them announced. \"Join us as we walk to the neighboring village to exchange greetings and share tales.\"\n\nThe younger sibling hesitated. \"I didn't bring any gifts,\" they whispered. The visitors reassured them, \"Fear not, for we bring gifts for all. You will be welcomed with warmth.\"\n\nDespite her sibling's apprehension, the elder agreed to join the travelers on their journey. As they departed, the remaining sibling returned home, anxious about the outcome of this sudden encounter.\n\nHours later, the younger sibling joined in a night of laughter and storytelling. Yet, as the first light of dawn arrived, she noticed something strange. One of the travelers, seemingly well just moments earlier, suddenly gasped and fell to the ground. The festive atmosphere turned somber, and the siblings watched in shock as the stranger's face twisted, and a dark liquid seeped from their lips. The younger sibling hurried back to her village, filled with dread.\n\nArriving home, she recounted the tale to her fellow villagers, her voice trembling as she tried to explain the unexplainable. As she finished her chilling account, she stumbled, falling to the ground. Those around her leapt back in horror as a dark pool spread beneath her, taking another soul."

            "In the waning light of dusk, a pair of siblings from the small village of Rolling Meadows ventured towards the edge of the woods, hopeful to catch a sight of the elusive blue wolf. The stillness of the evening was broken by the faint sound of a flute in the distance, making the duo halt in their tracks. \"Perhaps it's a local celebration,\" one sibling suggested, but the other remained doubtful. The tune of the flute grew louder, and through the dense trees emerged a procession of lights. Knowing they needed to find cover, they hid behind a large boulder.\n\nA group of travelers, draped in leaves and flowers, appeared from the shadows. Five figures, dressed in moss and petals, whispered amongst themselves. \"Friends, we have journeyed far and seek your companionship,\" one of them declared. \"Join us as we walk to the neighboring hamlet to exchange greetings and share tales of our travels.\"\n\nThe younger sibling hesitated, whispering, \"I didn't bring any gifts to offer.\" The visitors kindly reassured them, \"Fear not, for we bring gifts for all. You will be welcomed with open arms.\"\n\nDespite her sibling's hesitation, the elder agreed to join the travelers on their journey. As they left, the younger returned home, concerned about the unexpected encounter.\n\nNight fell, and the younger sibling joined in a night of joyous celebration and storytelling. But as the first light of dawn arrived, she saw something troubling. One of the travelers, previously lively, suddenly gasped and fell to the ground, their face contorted in pain. The festive atmosphere turned somber as the stranger's body convulsed, a dark liquid seeping from their mouth. Filled with dread, she returned home to share the harrowing news with her fellow villagers.\n\nArriving, her voice trembled as she recounted the disturbing tale, only to collapse, her body wracked with the same mysterious illness. Those nearby recoiled in horror as a dark pool formed beneath her, claiming another victim."

            "As twilight deepened in the quaint village of Whispering Hills, two sisters decided to explore the outskirts of the woods in search of the fabled golden fox. An enchanting melody on a pan flute reached their ears, causing them to pause. \"Maybe it's the local farmers' festival,\" one sister proposed, but the other felt uneasy. The music grew louder, and through the trees emerged a column of lanterns dancing in the dusk. Seeking concealment, they hid behind a mossy oak.\n\nApproaching them were a troupe of wandering performers draped in colorful ribbons and feathers. Five members of their troupe, adorned in shiny beads and sequins, huddled together in discussion. \"Kind strangers, we come from afar in search of friendship and wish to share stories of our adventures,\" said one of them. \"Come celebrate and dine with us in the village square!\"\n\nThe elder sister hesitated, concerned about not having any gifts to offer. The gracious performers insisted, \"Worry not, for we bring gifts for all. You will be our treasured guests.\"\n\nDespite her sister's apprehension, the younger agreed to join them.
