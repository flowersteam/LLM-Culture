Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

            "The argument against the belief of those, such as Mr. Gulick, that seclusion leads to species modification merits consideration, specifically the lack of transformation in places, like Ireland, where we would anticipate it. Ireland served as an ideal experiment due to its complete separation from Britain post-glacial epoch, estimated to be several thousand years. Nevertheless, not one of its mammals, reptiles, or land mollusks experiences any modification, despite visible environmental differences between the two areas. The absence of change through natural selection might be explained by a lesser struggle for existence because of fewer competing species. However, if isolation were a potent cause, it is astonishing that no significant alteration occurred within the span of thousands of years. The lack of modification in this scenario, as well as countless others, raises doubts about seclusion being a cause in and of itself.",
            "The argument against the belief that seclusion, similar to Mr. Gulick's perspective, promotes species modification merits consideration. This concern stems from the lack of observable transformation in places where such isolation would supposedly bring about changes. Ireland serves as a prime example, having been separated from Britain since the glacial epoch, presumably for numerous thousands of years. However, not a single mammal, reptile, or land mollusk there has exhibited any noticeable alteration. Despite obvious differences in the inorganic and organic environments, no modifications have taken place.\n\nPerhaps the absence of changes is due to the less intensive competition among species, resulting from a smaller number of competitors. Nevertheless, if seclusion holds the power to modify, it is incomprehensible that no significant transformation would have manifested in thousands of years. The absence of changes in Ireland, as well as other similar cases, casts doubt on whether seclusion holds intrinsic potential for triggering modifications."

The notable absence of modifications in Ireland, as well as in other analagous situations, challenges the notion that seclusion holds sufficient potential to instigate modifications."

Around 10,000 years ago, Ireland was geographically separate from Britain due to the glacial era, leading to unique ecological conditions. Yet, native Irish mammals, reptiles, and land snails show only minor evolutionary divergences. A possible explanation could be reduced inter-species competition, limiting the drive for intraspecific advancements. However, it's crucial to explore extensively the causes for the scarcity of significant evolutionary developments during these lengthy periods of isolation. The limited evidence supporting substantial evolutionary innovations in Ireland and comparable situations warrants a reconsideration of the theory that separation triggers significant evolutionary transformations.",
