Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

If isolation is indeed an influential factor in shaping species, the absence of changes in Ireland raises a significant concern. Despite this proven separation, virtually no modifications have been observed among its fauna.

This holds true despite noticeable differences in the environmental conditions, both organic and inorganic.\n\nIt is plausible that the absence of change is not a result of natural selection, owing to the fewer competing species demanding resources in these regions. However, if segregation itself was an influential factor, relentlessly and cumulatively working, it is inconceivable that no noteworthy alteration would have transpired in such extensive timeframes.\n\nHowever, the absence of notable changes in this, and numerous other cases of segregation, raises doubts that it can independently bring about modification.",

However, if separation were an influential factor, continuously and cumulatively acting, it's hard to imagine that no substantial transformation would have occurred in thousands of years. The absence of transformation in this case, as well as many others, suggests that isolation isn't inherently a cause of modifications.\n\n2. The belief that solitude, as championed by Mr. Gulick, instigates variations among species raises objections that warrant scrutiny. Significantly, the voidance of adaptations in areas where these beliefs would predict them is an issue. In Ireland, a trial situation exists: having been partitioned from Britain at the end of the glacial epoch, evidence suggests that this separation has lasted for multiple millennia. Though the inorganic and organic environments differ significantly, only a few mammals, reptiles, and land mollusks among its fauna have demonstrated even the slightest indication of evolution. This could be explained by a less intense competition between species resulting in lessened struggle for existence; however, if isolation drives modifications, it's inexplicable that no considerable transformations have arisen during thousands of years. The paucity of such changes in numerous instances of isolation leads one to question the assertion that it is itself an agent of evolution.\n\n3.
