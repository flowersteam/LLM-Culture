Here is the text: One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

            "Two friends from the small village of Nagulka decided to venture to the river one evening for some fishing, but as they arrived, the weather turned foggy and still. Suddenly, they heard distant shouting and feared it might be a hostile tribe. They hid behind a boulder, observing as several canoes approached, filled with warriors. \"Join us,\" they offered the frightened fishermen. \"We're heading upriver to raid another village.\" One fisherman declined, stating he had no weapons and that his family didn't know he was gone. Turning to his friend, he suggested, \"You should go with them.\"\n\nAnd so, one fisherman journeyed with the warriors upriver, while the other returned home. Approaching the opposing village, chaos ensued as the warriers attacked. Eventually, the young fisherman heard one warrior mutter, \"Quickly, we need to return home - that native has been struck!\" Fear washed over the fisherman, realizing the opponents were falling around him. \"They must be ghosts,\" he thought, as he'd never been injured despite their attack.\n\nThe warriors paddled back to Nagulka, where the fisherman stepped ashore, revealing his terrifying adventure to his fellow villagers. He spoke of fighting alongside supernatural beings and suffering a fatal wound. As he finished his tale, black liquid poured from his mouth, his face distorted, and he fell, dead. The sun rose to reveal the tragic aftermath - the fisherman's mysterious journey had led him to an unavoidable fate."

            "In the humble village of Luton, two friends set out for a day of fishing by the river, but as they arrived, the atmosphere shifted dramatically as a thick fog rolled in, accompanied by an eerie stillness. Their peaceful plans quickly turned tense as they heard muffled voices approaching. Fearing the worst, they hid behind a large rock, watching as several canoes filled with warriors came into view, their faces painted with symbols of war.\n\nThe leader of the warriors called out to the friends, inviting them to join their group on a journey upriver to raid an enemy village. One friend declined, expressing his lack of weapons and the fact that his family was unaware of his absence. Turning to his companion, he whispered, \"You should go with them.\"\n\nThus, one friend accompanied the warriors on their treacherous voyage, while the other returned to the safety of his home. Arriving at their destination, chaos ensued as the raiders attacked, wreaking havoc upon the village and its people.\n\nAs the battle raged, the fisherman suddenly heard one warrior whisper, \"Quickly, we need to return home - that native has been struck!\" Fear coursed through him as he realized that those around him were falling, cut down by the weapons of the supernatural beings he now fought alongside.\n\nUnable to comprehend how he remained unscathed amidst the violence, a terrifying thought struck him: \"They must be ghosts.\"\n\nUpon returning to Luton, the young fisherman recounted his journey and the horrific events that had unfolded. Tales of fighting alongside spectral warriors and sustaining a fatal wound left his fellow villagers in shock. As he reached the climax of his story, dark liquid spilled from his mouth, his face contorted in pain, and he collapsed, never to rise again.\n\nAs the sun rose the next morning, the true scope of the fisherman's tragic adventure was revealed. He had fallen victim to an unavoidable fate, forever intertwined with the supernatural forces that had both befriended and betrayed him."

            "In the modest village of Meadowgrove, two siblings decided to spend their day off exploring the nearby forest, but as they ventured deeper, the woods took on an ominous air, the trees looming over them with an unsettling silence. Their carefree outing turned somber when they heard distant, hushed voices echoing through the forest. Fearful of what might be lurking, they hid behind a thick oak, spying a group of hooded figures approaching. The leader, cloaked and masked, called out, inviting the siblings to join their secluded gathering in the heart of the forest. The sister hesitated, expressing their lack of preparedness, and whispered to her brother, \"You should go, I will wait here.\"\n\nThus, the brother followed the hooded figures, while the sister stayed behind, hidden. Upon arriving, strange rituals commenced, punctuated by cryptic incantations. Suddenly, the sister heard a faint whisper from her brother's direction, urging them to flee. But it was too late; she witnessed her brother's scream, cut short by a blinding flash.\n\nFrozen in terror, she waited until the dark figures left the scene. Returning home, she recounted her brother's sudden disappearance and her harrowing observation. A search party was formed, but they found no trace of her brother or the hidden gathering. Her brother's fate remains a mystery, an unsolved supernatural occurrence that forever altered her peaceful life. As she lives on, her tale becomes a whispered legend in Meadowgrove, a reminder of the unknown forces hidden in the quiet corners of the world."

What started as a light-hearted escapade shifted to unease when they picked up faint, muffled mutterings reverberating through the woods. Anxious about what could be lurking, they concealed themselves behind a sturdy oak, keeping a watchful eye on a cluster of hooded figures making their way towards them. The leader, draped and masked, summoned them to join the hidden assembly in the forest's heart. The sister hesitated, citing their unpreparedness, and whispered to her brother, \"You should go, I will wait here.\"\n\nTherefore, the brother accompanied the hooded figures while the sister stayed behind, concealed. Upon arriving, peculiar rituals unfolded, punctuated by cryptic chants. Suddenly, the sister detected a faint murmur from her brother's location, pleading for them to escape. However, it was too late; she saw her brother's cry, abruptly cut off by a dazzling burst.\n\nParalyzed with fear, she stayed put until the mysterious figures left the scene. Making her way back home, she shared the story of her brother's abrupt departure and her own harrowing ordeal. A search party was organized, but not a single clue of the brother or the secretive gathering materialized. Her brother's destiny remains a puzzle, an uncanny supernatural event forever imprinting itself on her tranquil life. As she carries on, her story becomes a hushed legend in Willowspring, serving as a reminder of the mysterious forces lurking in the calm corners of the world."

A simple outing turned tense when they discerned muffled voices echoing through the forest. Worried about the unknown, they hid behind a sturdy pine, warily observing a group of cloaked figures approaching them.
