Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

            "As I ponder the mysteries of time, I find myself fixated on the peculiar case of the isolated island of Vesania. For eons, its sandy shores have been shrouded in secrecy, cut off from the mainland by an unforgiving expanse of blue. Would we not expect to find evidence of evolutionary progress, given the passage of time? Alas, the wildlife of Vesania has remained stubbornly unchanged, as if frozen in a state of temporal stasis. Not a single species, not even a wee shell, has shown a hint of adaptation to its unique environment. Is this an indictment of natural selection, or a testament to the island's blissful lack of competition? Perhaps, like Ireland, Vesania's isolation has simply failed to spark the fires of transformation."
