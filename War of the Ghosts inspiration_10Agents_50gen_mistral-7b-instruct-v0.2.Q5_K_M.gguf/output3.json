Here is the text: One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

            "Two brothers from the mystical lands of Egulac ventured one evening to the shores of the tranquil river, armed with hopes to claim the elusive seals. As the night blanketed the world in a layer of mist, they became aware of eerie war calls, their imaginations conjuring up the terror of an impending war party. They swiftly retreated to the safety of the shore, concealing themselves behind a sturdy log. In the quiet of the night, canoes emerged from the fog, guided by the rhythmic beat of paddles. A crew of ten men grounded their vessel close by, inviting the brothers:_\"Join us on a perilous journey upriver. We plan to wage war on a neighboring tribe.\"_ One brother hesitated, _\"My arrows are not here with me. I fear the unknown, and my kin would mourn for me. But you, my dear brother, take this chance if you wish.\"_ With hesitant eyes, one brother parted ways with his sibling amid the voices of his newfound comrades. The brotherless canoe sailed onward, reaching hostile shores where the rhythm of battle drums and the cries of warriors shook the ground. The violence brought a tide of bloodshed, with lives claimed on both ends. However, not all who fought could claim the luxury of surviving memories, as one of the warriors grew weary, struck down by an unseen enemy. In the aftermath, the victorious party returned home, bearing the story of a heroic yet fatal encounter. The brother told his tale of ghostly warriors and the great battle victories, until the sun crept from behind the horizon, casting his final rays upon the fallen war hero. As the sun vanished, a dark substance emerged from the fallen's mouth, releasing a silent yet chilling confirmation of his demise. The people mourned, their sorrow seeping into the land as the first star graced the evening sky.",
            "Two evenings ago, two bold adventurers set out from the Egulac village to the riverbank in pursuit of elusive river otters. The serene night was soon enshrouded in a thick, ghostly fog. Sudden war cries pierced the air, causing the young men to cower and conceal themselves behind a large, weathered log. As the winds whispered through the trees, the savory scent of canoes filled the night. Five formidable warriors emerged, urging the pair to join their expedition upriver. One youth expressed his reluctance, citing the absence of arrows and the concern for his family's safety. The other young man, however, eagerly accepted the invitation.\n\nAs the warriors continued upriver, a skirmish broke out at a neighboring village. The once tranquil waters of the Kalama River echoed with the din of battle. Many lives were claimed that fateful night. Yet, our young compatriot remained unscathed. Instinctively, he felt an overwhelming sensation that the warriors could not be ordinary men. Mortality seemed to evade him. Upon their return to Egulac, our silent hero recounted the tales to those around him with great detail, recalling tales of popular brave men and their fallen counterparts.\n\nThe sun had barely risen when a startling transformation overtook him. A deep, malignant darkness exuded from within. His visage contorted into an expression of eternal torment. Hysteria ensued as the villagers mourned the loss of their once brave and treasured companion, now claimed by the very war that he had inadvertently returned from.",
            "Two brothers from the tranquil village of Egulac embarked on a moonlit night to hunt beavers near the riverbanks. The night was serene, broken only by the gentle sounds of nature. But suddenly, the stillness was shattered by eerie war-cries. Convinced that an enemy war-party was approaching, the brothers hurriedly fled to the shore and concealed themselves behind a large boulder.\n\nAs the darkness deepened, canoes filled with determined warriors glided quietly towards them. The brothers listened intently to their advances, hearing the efficient rhythm of oars. When one canoe neared, the warriors revealed their intention.\n\n\"Join us,\" they invited excitedly. \"We're embarking on a journey to wage war on an enemy tribe.\"\n\nThe first brother hesitated, fearful for his life and uncertain if his relatives were aware of his whereabouts. But he urged his younger brother to accept the offer. \"You may go,\" he said, \"I cannot accompany you.\"\n\nThe younger brother cautiously agreed, and the warriors continued on their mission up the river. As they arrived, the enemy encampment was roused from slumber. A fierce scalping battle ensued, leaving a catastrophic toll on both sides.\n\nAmidst the chaos, however, one of the warriors was struck down. The rumors of his demise reached the younger man. He found himself startled by the apparent supernatural power of his ghostly allies. As the sun peeked over the horizon, the man rushed home to recount the extraordinary tale, his body seemingly unharmed.\n\nBut his sense of victory was fleeting. As the day progressed, the subtle signs of his injury grew apparent. Gathered around the fire, family and villagers watched in shock as the wounded man transformed. The black substance seeping from his lips, the contorted face \u2013 it was undeniable. Their brother was dead.",
            "Two friends from the village of Nissitah went to the river one evening with the intent of hunting beavers. The tranquility of the night was shattered by the emergence of a thick fog and eerie war cries. Fearing the approach of an enemy force, they hastily made their way to the shore and concealed themselves behind a large driftwood. Suddenly, a group of canoes appeared, their occupants calling out for reinforcement in their quest for conquest. One of the friends declared his inability to participate, \"I have no weapons,\" he protested. \"But fear not,\" they replied, \"we have ample arrows in our canoe.\" Built on the brink of potential betrayal, one friend hesitantly accompanied them, while the other chose to return to his loved ones. The warriors traveled upriver and clashed with an unsuspecting enemy, resulting in significant causalities. The survivor from our group, filled with overwhelming fear, believed his comrades to be ethereal beings. Unharmed, but mistakenly assumed to be injured, he rejoined his community to recount the horrific tale of their spectral encounter. However, as the sun rose, the true consequences of his decision became apparent. His face contorted, a dark substance gushed from his mouth and he collapsed, dead.",
            "Under a starlit night, two adolescent men from the village of Nimpkish embarked on a seal hunt by the riverbank. The tranquility was suddenly disrupted by the creeping fog and the crisp war-cries in the distance. Their minds raced, \"Could this be an enemy raid?\" They swiftly sought cover behind a large boulder.\n\nDark silhouettes emerged from the mist, revealing war canoes adorned with menacing feathers and painted faces. A voice called out, 'Join us as we journey upriver to confront our adversaries.' The first man hesitated, replying, 'My quiver is empty.'\n\nHis companion, unafraid, responded, 'Fear not, arrows are plentiful in the canoe.' But the first hesitated once more, 'My family would mourn for me, should I perish in battle.' So, one chose to venture forth, while the other chose to safeguard his people.\n\nThus, the war party continued on their treacherous path, arriving at a fortified town just beyond the waters of Kalama. The villagers charged in defense, and a grueling battle ensued. Lives on both sides were lost interminably. Yet, our hero, clad in the armor of valor, heard a comrade cry for retreat.\n\nIn an instant, he believed, \"They have become spirits,\" and he did not perceive injury, yet the warriors insisted that he had sustained a wound. The canoes returned to Nimpkish, and the young man wondered if he, too, was now dead.\n\nHe arrived at his village and, with a flicker of the fire, shared the chilling tale. 'Know this, my kin, I accompanied the spirits tonight. Among us and them, a brutal confrontation ensued. Many lives were claimed in this ensanguined skirmish.' He lived on, recounting the tale, but as the sun rose and the darkness waned, a black terrifying substance expelled from his mouth, signifying his ultimate demise. The people mourned, for he had become one with the dead.",

Hastily, they fled to the shore and concealed themselves behind a large, fallen tree.\n\nBefore long, canoes emerged from the mist. Five men in the lead canoe summoned the young men. \"Consider our offer,\" they urged. \"Join us on our expedition to the towns upriver. War awaits.\" One declared,\" I lack ammunition.\", but the other, intrigued, agreed.\n\nLeading the reluctant recruit, they reached the targeted village. The conflict erupted swiftly and mercilessly, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides. Yet, the young man remained miraculously unharmed - at least, that's what they thought.\n\nOne warrior proclaimed, \"Hurry back home. Our comrade has been struck down.\" The young man reflected, \"Perhaps they were not of this world.\" He felt no pain, yet feared for his identity, unsure of how to reveal his involvement.\n\nWhen they returned to Egulac, the warrior took his leave. The young man returned to his family, recounting his spectral journey and the horrific battle's outcome. The villagers listened in horrified fascination.\n\nBut as the sun began to rise, he suddenly collapsed. A profound silence fell. Something dark and twisted emerged from his now lifeless mouth. Despite his earlier story, he was no longer among the living.",
            "Two brothers from the village of Wisconiyama set out one night to hunt beavers at the river's edge. As twilight deepened, the scene transformed into an ethereal canvas of mist and tranquility. As they worked in silence, they suddenly heard echoing war cries reverberating through the forest. Their hearts pounded; perhaps this was an invading force. Swiftly, they hid behind a submerged tree trunk.\n\nSoon enough, canoes appeared out of the fog, the sound of paddles slapping against the water growing louder. Five warriors emerged, their painted faces fierce. \"Join us,\" they urged, their intent clear: an upstream raid was imminent.\n\nThe elder brother hesitated, \"I have no weapons.\" A response came from one of the warriors: \"Arrows are in the canoe.What's holding you back? Your relatives are unaware of your journey. But you, my friend, may proceed with us.\"\n\nHesitant but compelled, the elder brother stepped into the canoe. His younger brother, however, decided to return home. The warriors continued their journey, up the river to a hidden encampment of their enemies.\n\nA battle ensued, the clashing of weapons and war hoops reverberating through the air. Lives were lost on both sides. But the elder brother heard a characteristic noise, \"Quick, let us return home: that comrade has fallen!\" He realized in horror, they were spirits, their bodies defeated in battle.\n\nAs the sun began to rise, the elder brother made his way back to his village, his tale a testament to an extraordinary experience. He told his tribe, \"I've been with the heavens, waging war. Our kin fell, and our foes, too. They believed I perished, but I remained unharmed.\" Alas, the deception could not last; the elder brother's body succumbed to the spiritual injuries he had received in the ethereal conflict, and he passed on.",
            "Two friends from the village of Nisqually set out for a night of seal hunting near the tranquil waters. As they huddled close to the shore, the temperature dropped, and the river fog rolled in. Sudden war cries echoed through the stillness of the night, sending their hearts racing. They sought cover behind a large tree trunk, fearing a surprise attack.\n\nStrobe lights of canoes illuminated the scene, revealing a line of war boats come to claim the land. The five men whom emerged demanded the young men to join their cause.\n\n\"I have no weapons,\" asserted one. \"We will provide you with what you need,\" they replied. \"Think not of your family, the unknown could save them.\" However, the first hesitated.\" But you, my friend,\" they encouraged, turning to the other. \"Join us, and we vow to protect our people against this impending threat.\"\n\nThe second hesitated no longer. With a leap, he plunged into the canoe, shielded by the illusion of safety. However, the first could not shake the unquiet sensation in his heart. Reclaimed by the sunrise, he returned home, unwilling to risk his life.\n\nAnd so the vessels set sail, Led by the deception of false promises, embarking on a war-filled journey to a distant tribe residing across the swift Kalama River. The people gathered and clashed, lives spilled, a grim tally of the night's conquest.\n\nThe young man, still alive and untouched, heard the call to return. Fearful, he assumed the warriors were spirits. But alas, he was struck by arrows\u2014 cumulative injuries he ignored until the faintness took him.\n\nThe canoes returned to Nisqually, bearing the silent hero. He warmed himself by the fire, and spoke of his trip amongst the phantoms, sharing tales of lives obliterated, and the triumphant revenge on their attackers. Yet, as if touched by the morning sun, he succumbed to the eternal rest. The void surrendered its secrets, swallowing the lifeless form of the young warrior, leaving his people to mourn.",
            "Two brothers from the village of Wohelo ventured to the river one evening for seal hunting. The tranquility was sudden, the fog rolled in, and soon enough, ominous war cries echoed.
