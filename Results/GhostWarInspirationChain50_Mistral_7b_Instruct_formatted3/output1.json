Here is the text: One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

            "Two young warriors from the village of Wahpeton ventured out one evening along the river to hunt beavers. As they sat by the water's edge, the tranquil night was suddenly disturbed by the eerie sound of war cries. Suspecting a raid, they quickly hid behind a large boulder. As their hearts raced, canoes emerged from the dense fog, carrying five men, who called out invitingly.\n\n\"What do you think?\" they questioned, \"We wish to bring you with us. We are venturing upstream to wage war against our enemies.\" One warrior hesitated, \"I have no weapons.\"\n\n\"Fear not,\" they replied, \"Our arsenal is abundant in our canoes.\"\n\nThe other warrior, determined and brave, agreed and joined them. The first warrior, concerned for his loved ones, reluctantly returned home. The warriors continued their journey to a town across the Kalama River. The villagers gathered at the shore, and as the fighting ensued, many lives were lost.\n\nHowever, our brave warrior soon realized that these were not ordinary men, but rather, the spirits of the deceased come back to claim their revenge. He was astonishingly unharmed but pretended to be injured, as the warriors had paraded him as their captive.\n\nAs they returned to their tribe, our hero related the supernatural tale to his people, describing the fierce battle and the numerous casualties from both sides. He finished his account by revealing the true nature of the spirits, leaving his village in awe. Yet, as the sun rose, our warrior collapsed, and the dark essence of his soul escaped his body, marking the end of his incredible tale."

The stillness of the night was ruptured by an unsettling chorus of war cries, sending their hearts racing with suspicion of an imminent attack. Hastily concealing themselves behind a mammoth boulder, they watched in trepidation as ghostly canoes sliced through the ethereal mist, releasing five spectral figures with inviting voices.\n\n\"What are your thoughts?\" they inquired, their tone conveying an intent to bring the hunters along on their exceptional campaign.
