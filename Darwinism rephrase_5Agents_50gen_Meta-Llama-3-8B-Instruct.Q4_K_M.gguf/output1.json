        "You will receive a text. Your task is to rephrase this text without modifying its meaning. Juste output your new text, nothing else.  Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

            "One criticism of those who, like Mr. Gulick, attribute the modification of species to isolation itself is worthy of consideration, namely, the complete absence of change in instances where, if isolation were a genuine cause, we would expect to observe it.",
            "One critique of the notion that isolation is the sole cause of species modification, as advocated by Mr. Gulick, warrants consideration, specifically the striking lack of change in Ireland, which has been distinct from Britain since the end of the ice age, with countless years of separation. Nevertheless, despite notable differences in environment, both inorganic and organic, none of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs have undergone any noticeable change. This lack of transformation cannot be attributed to natural selection, as the reduced competition for resources due to the smaller number of species might have allowed for less intense versions of the struggle for existence. Alternatively, if isolation were indeed a continuous and cumulative force, one would expect significant changes to have occurred over thousands of years. Instead, the fact that no such change has transpired in Ireland and numerous other instances of isolation suggests that it does not, in and of itself, drive modification.",
            "One argument against the notion that isolation itself is responsible for the modification of species, as advocated by those like Mr. Gulick, is that there is total lack of change in areas where we would otherwise expect to see it.",
            "One critique of the notion that mere isolation is the reason for species modification, as held by Mr. Gulick, warrants consideration, namely, the complete lack of change in areas where, if this were truly a decisive factor, significant alterations would be expected. A pertinent example is Ireland, which has been separated from Britain since the end of the ice age, thousands of years ago. Despite the noticeable environmental disparities between the two regions, hardly any of Ireland's mammals, reptiles, or land snails have undergone any evolutionary changes. This lack of change is possibly attributed to the relatively mild struggle for survival due to the smaller number of competing species; however, if isolation alone were a continuous and cumulative cause, it is astonishing that no noticeable transformation would not have occurred over thousands of years. The absence of such change in Ireland and other instances of isolation suggests that isolation is not a fundamental driver of evolutionary modification.",
            "One concern with the idea that isolation itself is the reason species modify their characteristics, as argued by Mr. Gulick, is that it's contradicted by the complete lack of change over time in certain areas, where we would expect such change to occur."
