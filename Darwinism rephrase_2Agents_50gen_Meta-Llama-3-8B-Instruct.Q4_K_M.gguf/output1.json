        "You will receive a text. Your task is to rephrase this text without modifying its meaning. Juste output your new text, nothing else.  Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

            "One criticism of the view that isolation is a primary cause of modification of species, as advocated by Mr. Gulick, warrants consideration. This is the complete lack of change in certain places where, if isolation were indeed a significant factor, we would expect to observe it. For instance, Ireland presents a suitable test case, as it has been severed from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, a time span of many thousands of years. Nevertheless, a review of its mammal, reptile, and land mollusk populations reveals that hardly any have undergone any modifications, even in the face of distinct environmental differences, both inorganic and organic. It may be argued that the absence of evolution through natural selection is due to the less intense struggle for existence resulting from the smaller number of competing species. However, if isolation were a continuous and cumulative force, it is implausible that no noticeable change would have accrued over thousands of years. The fact that no such change has occurred in Ireland and other instances of isolation suggests that isolation is not inherently a driving force of modification."
