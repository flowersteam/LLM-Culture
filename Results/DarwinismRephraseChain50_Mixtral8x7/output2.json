Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

            "##TEXT## The idea, initially suggested by certain individuals such as Mr. Gulick, about insulation leading to distinct species has faced criticisms. The anticipated developments seem to be missing from the areas where they should be evident. For instance, Ireland, separated from Britain since the end of the ice age, has witnessed changes in its ecological and biological frameworks. However, the evolution of its mammals, reptiles, and land snails has been surprisingly slow. This could be due to a lower impact of natural selection caused by a decrease in competition among fewer species. If insulation was a constant factor, notable changes should have emerged over thousands of years. The absence of these changes, not only in this situation but in multiple isolated scenarios, implies that insulation might not be the primary determinant. ##TEXTEND##"

The anticipated progress seems to be missing in the places where it should be evident. For instance, Ireland, isolated from Britain since the end of the ice age, has experienced shifts in its ecological and biological systems. However, the evolution of its mammals, reptiles, and land snails has been surprisingly slow. This could be due to a weakened influence of natural selection resulting from a decline in competition among fewer species. If insulation was a persistent element, substantial changes should have appeared over thousands of years.
