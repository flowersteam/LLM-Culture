Here is the text: One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

            "Two young men from Egulac ventured to the river one evening for seal hunting. The night turned foggy and tranquil. Suddenly, war cries echoed, and they suspected an enemy approach. Hastily, they concealed themselves near the shore behind a large log. Unseen canoes advanced, their paddles distinct in the quiet night. A canoe drew nearer, revealing five men. They proposed, 'Don't you want to join us? We're headed upstream for battle.'\n\nOne young man replied, 'I lack arrows.' The men reassured him, 'Arrows are in the canoe.' However, he refused to go, fearing for his safety and considering the potential consequences for his family. The other young man was given the opportunity to accompany the warriors. Reluctantly, he accepted the proposition.\n\nThe warriors continued their journey upstream, reaching a town beyond Kalama. The inhabitants arrived to engage in battle. Casualties mounted proportionally on both sides, but the young man remained unscathed-or so he believed. He heard a fighter announce, 'Quick, let's retreat: That Indian has been wounded.'\n\nAt this point, the young man pondered, 'Maybe they're spirits.' He didn't feel ill, but he was informed that he had sustained a gunshot wound. Intrigued, the warriors returned to Egulac, and the young man made his way home, recounting his surreal experiences to the village.\n\nAs the sun arose, he suddenly fell lifeless by the fire. A dark substance emerged from his mouth, and his face twisted in agony. The people were shocked, comforting one another,...he had passed.",
            "Two young men from Egulac went seal hunting one night, but the calm and foggy conditions were soon interrupted by war cries. Believing it could be a war party, they fled to the shore and hid behind a log. Several canoes arrived, and the men inside requested that one of the young men join them for an upcoming attack on a nearby village. One man declined, citing a lack of arrows and concern for his safety and family's uncertainty about his whereabouts. The other young man agreed and boarded the canoe with the warriors. They proceeded to engage in battle, resulting in the deaths of many on both sides. Upon their return, the young man narrated the encounter and, although unharmed, appeared to have been injured based on the warring party's claims. A short time after sharing his experience, he fell down, revealing a black substance from his mouth and a contorted face. Shocked and saddened, the people realized he had died from his supposed injuries."
