        "You will receive a text. Your task is to rephrase this text without modifying its meaning. Juste output your new text, nothing else.  Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

            "One criticism of the views of those, such as Mr. Gulick, who consider isolation a driving force behind the modification of species warrants consideration, namely, the complete lack of changes in those isolated environments where, according to this theory, we should expect to observe significant modifications.",
            "One criticism of the idea that isolation alone leads to the modification of species, as advocated by Mr. Gulick, warrants consideration: the complete lack of change in areas where, if this were a true cause, we would indeed expect to see it. A prime example of such a case is Ireland, which has been separated from Britain since the end of the last ice age, a time span of thousands of years. Despite this, the country's mammals, reptiles, and land snails show no signs of modification, despite evident differences in their environment. It is possible that the absence of change through natural selection is due to the more relaxed struggle for existence resulting from the smaller number of competing species. However, if isolation were a continuously and cumulatively effective cause of change, it is hard to understand why no significant change would have occurred over thousands of years. The fact that no such change has taken place in Ireland and many other instances of isolation suggests that isolation alone is not a driver of modification.",
            "One criticism of the notion that isolation is sufficient to cause modifications to species, a view shared by Mr. Gulick, is worthy of consideration. It points out that there is no instance of change in Ireland, despite its separation from Britain since the end of the ice age, thousands of years ago. In fact, most of its mammals, reptiles, and land molluscs remain unchanged, despite clear differences in both inorganic and organic environmental conditions. If natural selection were not at play, the reduced competition due to fewer competing species might be a plausible explanation. However, if isolation were a continuous and cumulative cause of change, it is hard to accept that no distinct changes have occurred over thousands of years. The lack of change in Ireland and similar cases of isolation suggests that isolation alone is not a sufficient cause of modification.",
            "One challenge to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, think isolation is responsible for the modification of species is the complete lack of change in certain parts of the world where we would expect to find it, given the duration of their isolation. For example, Ireland has been separated from Britain for thousands of years, yet its mammals, reptiles, and land molluscs have remained largely unchanged, despite noticeable environmental differences. It's possible that this is due to the relatively mild struggle for existence due to the smaller number of competing species. However, if isolation were a continuous and cumulative force, we would expect to see significant changes over thousands of years. Since this is not the case, it appears that isolation is not in itself a cause of modification.",
            "The notion that geographical isolation alone is responsible for the modification of species should be reevaluated, as it is evident in Ireland's case that no significant change has occurred in its flora and fauna despite being separated from Britain for thousands of years, despite the distinct differences in environment."
