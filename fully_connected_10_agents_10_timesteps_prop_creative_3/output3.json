The villagers lived harmoniously, believing in the enchanting magic that surrounded their home. One day, a stranger arrived in Taddleton. He had a sense of magic about him, but what was odd was that he wasn't reducing the paperwork load at all.\n\nThis stranger, whose name was Oswin, traveled with a small bag filled with ancient scrolls. Every night, he retreated to the Baldstone Oak, a giant wooden guardian that had stood in the heart of the village for generations. There, Oswin would pull from his bag the most fantastical, well-creased scrolls, and when he unrolled them- he would laugh.\n\nA hushed silence would fall over the village, for the tales he would read were of another world, one of endless joy and dancing. The villagers, including the small child named Isabella, would gather beneath the trees to listen to the mystical stories Oswin would bring to their small, charming town.\n\nIsabella's favorite part of daily life in Taddleton wasn't having to do her chores, or eating her mother's cooking, or going to the mysterious English treasure chest of heart warmers she called the art of dancing \u2013 it was hearing Oswin's stories.\n\nOne sunny afternoon, Oswin shared a story about a beautiful, enchanted feather that could give the wearer the power to levitate. Isabella's eyes lit up, her dreams giddy with the prospect of floating in the sky. This was something more than just a frilled robe that could make a grown woman dance.\n\nIntrigued, she sought the stranger's guidance.

Isabella agreed immediately, her heart swelling with hope.\n\nIn the eerie forest just beyond the village, Oswin led Isabella to a mystical cave that had laid hidden for centuries. The cave held countless magical items, each with its own purpose. And, sitting atop a carved wooden pedestal, lay the enchanted feather.\n\nSeeing",
