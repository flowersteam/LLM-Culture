            "7: 7: The selected story is:\\\\n\\\\nOnce upon a time in the magical kingdom of Elyria, there lived a young girl named Lily. Lily was unlike any other child in the kingdom, for she possessed a gift that set her apart from her peers. She had the ability to communicate with animals. It was one fine, golden autumn day when Lily found herself wandering through the woods near her family's cottage. Suddenly, Lily heard a soft, scratching sound coming from a small bush. She approached curiously and parted the branches, making sure not to hurt the fragile plants that held them together. Within, she discovered a tiny, timid squirrel lying injured. It had somehow fallen from its home in the tall, verdant canopy. The poor creature was fractured and stranded, unable to climb back up to safety. Lily felt a pang of sadness for the helpless critter. In that moment, the squirrel looked up at her with frightened, innocent eyes and Lily's heart cracked wide open. She could see the pain and worry etched upon the creature's tiny face. Instinctively, she cradled the squirrel in her hands, offering gentle words of reassurance. As she whispered comforting words, nature itself appeared. Blue and Green, two celestial beings, stood flanking this enchanting scene. They explained that they could not intervene directly, but they would provide a cure for the squirrel's injury. Lily, with the help of the celestial beings, crafted a powerful potion from rare herbs and enchanted spring water. She gently administered it to the creature, which soon began to show signs of healing. The frightened squirrel slowly regained confidence and comfort, eventually accepting Lily as its only friend. Word traveled fast about Lily's gift and soon, she was known as Elyria's own talking-animal whisperer. She now spent her days healing and nurturing well-being in injured animals. Meanwhile, Fido stood steadfast by Lily's side, a proud, loving guardian who shared her adventures and compassionate moments.",

Lily was unlike any other child in the kingdom, for she possessed a gift that set her apart from her peers. She had the ability to communicate with animals.

She discovered a small bush that seemed out of place, and as she looked closer, she found a tiny, frightened squirrel. The squirrel was injured and unable to climb back up to the safety of its home in the trees. Lily, compassionate and brave, cradled the squirrel in her hands, offering comfort and support. With the guidance of celestial beings, she was able to create a healing potion that began to mend the squirrel's injuries. Gradually, the squirrel regained its confidence and trust in Lily, forming an unbreakable bond between them.

            "Once upon a time in the magical kingdom of Elyria, there lived a young girl named Lily. Lily was unlike any other child in the kingdom, for she possessed a gift that set her apart from her peers. She had the ability to communicate with animals. It was one fine, golden autumn day when Lily found herself wandering through the woods near her family's cottage. Suddenly, Lily heard a soft, scratching sound coming from a small bush. She approached curiously and parted the branches, making sure not to hurt the fragile plants that held them together. Within, she discovered a tiny, timid squirrel lying injured. It had somehow fallen from its home in the tall, verdant canopy. The poor creature was fractured and stranded, unable to climb back up to safety. Lily felt a pang of sadness for the helpless critter.
