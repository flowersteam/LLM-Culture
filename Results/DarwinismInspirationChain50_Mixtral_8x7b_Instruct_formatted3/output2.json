Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

            "The argument that separation and isolation can lead to the development of new species has been put forward by several theorists. However, one must consider the lack of transformation in certain isolated systems, as seen in the case of the British and Irish islands. For thousands of years, Ireland has been separated from Britain, and yet, the fauna on the island, including mammals, reptiles, and land mollusks, have remained static with no signs of significant change or evolution. This is despite the distinct differences in the environment and the struggle for existence that exists in such isolated conditions. If isolation were indeed a cause of modification, it is perplexing that no changes have been observed over such a long period. The absence of modification in this, and many other cases of isolation, suggests that isolation alone may not be a sufficient cause of speciation. Other factors, such as environmental pressures, genetic drift, and natural selection may also play crucial roles in the modification and survival of species in isolated conditions."

            "While some have proposed that insulation and detachment can spur the emergence of new species, this notion may be more complex than it appears. A case in point is the separation of the British and Irish islands, where Ireland has been isolated from Britain for thousands of years. Despite the distinct environmental differences between the two islands, the fauna on Ireland, including mammals, reptiles, and land mollusks, have remained largely unchanged. This raises questions about the role of isolation in promoting speciation, as it seems that other factors could be at play. Perhaps genetic drift, environmental pressures, or natural selection could also play significant roles in driving the adaptation and survival of species in isolated conditions. Thus, while isolation might create the conditions for new species to evolve, it is likely that other mechanisms must also be present for this to occur."

            "Although the idea that insularity and detachment foster the development of distinct species has been suggested, this process may be more intricate than it seems. The splitting of the British and Irish isles serves as a prime example, as Ireland has been detached from Britain for thousands of years, resulting in distinct environmental differences between the two. However, the mammals, reptiles, and land mollusks in Ireland have remained strikingly similar to their British counterparts. This raises doubts about the role of isolation in driving speciation and suggests that other factors, such as genetic drift, environmental pressures, or natural selection, could be crucial to the adaptation and survival of species in isolated conditions. Hence, while isolation can establish the right conditions for new species to emerge, other mechanisms are likely necessary for speciation to take place."

The similarities between the mammals, reptiles, and land mollusks in the geographically isolated Ireland and Britain provide a case in point. Despite being separated for thousands of years, these species have remained remarkably alike, indicating that other forces are at play. Factors such as genetic drift, environmental pressures, or natural selection may all contribute to the adaptation and survival of species in isolated habitats. Therefore, although isolation can set the stage for speciation, it is likely that a combination of other mechanisms is required for this process to fully unfold."

Despite the physical divide and a long history of separation, these species have persisted in maintaining striking similarities. This suggests that other agents, such as genetic drift, environmental pressures, or natural selection, play crucial roles in shaping the adaptation and survival of species in isolated environments.
