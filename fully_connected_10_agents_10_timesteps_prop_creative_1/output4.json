The realm was at peace as long as one sacred rule was obeyed \u2013 the Sealed Sacral Calendar, which dictated the proper times for practicing magic. However, deep within the enchanted forest that surrounded the village lived a tribe of magical creatures known as the Whispering Woods. These mystical beings lived separately from the villagers, their lives governed by the melody of the woodsongs that echoed through their domain.\n\nIn the heart of this forest, a young girl named Adara arrived, seeking answers about her true origin.
