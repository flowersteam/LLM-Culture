Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

            "In the realm of natural history, there exists a long-held hypothesis suggesting that isolation contributes to the evolutionary process. However, this assumption warrants scrutiny, as evidenced by the case of Ireland. Separated from Britain following the glacial epoch, approximately 10,000 years ago, Ireland presents a unique opportunity to examine the effects of isolation on its indigenous fauna.\n\nDespite the vast time elapsed, no significant modifications have been observed among Ireland's mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs. This is particularly intriguing since the environments in Ireland and Britain exhibit noticeable disparities, both in their inorganic and organic components.\n\nNatural selection may not have played a role in shaping these species, which could be attributed to the relatively smaller number of competitors, leading to less extreme competition for resources. However, considering the proposition that isolation itself is a driving force of modifications, it is inexplicable that no noticeable evolutions have occurred after thousands of years of isolation.\n\nWhere other instances of isolation have been documented, similar patterns of species stasis have emerged. These observations challenge the assumption that isolation is a decisive factor in shaping species, casting doubts on the widespread belief that isolation is inherently responsible for modifications.",
            "While the theory advocated by Mr. Gulick, suggesting isolation as a catalyst for species modification, is intriguing, it faces a significant challenge. The absence of transformation in species isolated for extensive periods, like those in Ireland separated from Britain since the last glacial epoch, raises eyebrows. Despite the pronounced differences in the ecosystem, there is scant evidence of change among Irish mammals, reptiles, and land molluscs.\n\nIn fact, Ireland provides an unparalleled opportunity to assess this hypothesis, as the only variations observed are likely due to gene flow or other external factors. The stability of these distinct species does not support the idea that isolation is an inherent cause of modification. Instead, it appears that the minor competition among species in Ireland might be responsible for the lack of significant change. Yet, if isolation were an effective trigger, generating continuous and cumulative impacts, it is perplexing that no discernible change has emerged over thousands of years. Therefore, the consistent absence of change in numerous isolated cases is compelling evidence that isolation itself is not the primary cause of species adaptation."

Yet, this notion merits a second glance, as revealed by the peculiar case of Ireland. Svengali to Britain following the late glacial epoch, nearly 10,000 years ago, Ireland stands as a captivating stage to scrutinize the impacts of seclusion on its native creatures.\\\n\\\nDespite the elapsed expanse of time, scant variations have manifested among Ireland's mammals, reptiles, and land molluscs. Intriguingly, this unfolds despite the stark contrasts between the environments in Ireland and Britain, a disparity that extends to both their inorganic and organic components.\\\n\\\nCould it be that the Machiavellian hand of natural selection has been absent in molding these entities? This could presumably be attributed to the comparatively diminished competition among species in Ireland, implying less formidable contests for resources. Alternatively, it may beggar belief that, despite the unyielding isolation, absolutely no progressive evolutions have unfurled over millennia. \\\n\\\nElsewhere, instances of seclusion have delivered paralleled stories of species stasis. These findings question the assumption that seclusion alone ushers in transformations, casting a shadow of uncertainty over the widely-held creed that seclusion is an inherent architect of modifications.",
