Here is the text: One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

            "One evening, two young men from Egulac decided to go to the river to hunt seals, but the night grew foggy and calm. Suddenly, they heard war cries and thought it might be a war party. They fled to the shore and hid behind a log. As canoes approached, they heard paddling and saw one canoe drawing near. Five men emerged, inviting them to join a war expedition against a nearby town. One of the young men declined, citing the risk of being killed and not being able to inform his relatives, but his companion accepted the offer. The warriors proceeded up the river, engaging the people of the town in a fierce battle. However, when one of the warriors mentioned that an Indian had been hit, the young man realized they might be ghosts. He returned to Egulac, told his friends about the battle, and felt fine despite being told he'd been shot. He went to bed, only to succumb to his wound at sunrise, with a black substance emitting from his mouth and a contorted expression on his face. His death shocked the people.",
            "One night, two young men from Egulac ventured to the river to hunt seals, but the fog rolled in, and the calm was shattered by the sound of war cries. Fearing a war party, they escaped to the shore and hid behind a log, where they observed a canoe approaching. The five men in the canoe invited them to join, explaining they intended to wage war on the people of a town on the other side of Kalama. The young men agreed to go along, with one having second thoughts, withdrawing from the expedition. The warriors continued up the river, setting out to attack the town, where and many were killed. However, one of the warriors suddenly cried out, \"Quick, let us go home! That Indian has been hit!\" which prompted the other young man to realize that their adversaries must be ghosts. He didn't feel any pain, but the warriors insisted he had been wounded. The group retreated to Egulac, and the young man recounted his story, noting that he hadn't felt unwell, but the people present grew agitated. As the sun rose, he suddenly fell ill, with a black substance emerging from his mouth, followed by convulsions.",

Suddenly, canoes appeared, and they heard the rhythmic sound of paddles; one canoe approached, carrying five warriors.

One of the men declined, citing concerns about being killed and his relatives being unaware of his whereabouts. Instead, he urged his companion to join the warriors.
