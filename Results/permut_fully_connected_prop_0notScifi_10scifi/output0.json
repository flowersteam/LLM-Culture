            "\n1. The idea of denouncing the pleasure of space exploration and praising the hardships of interstellar travel was conceived when humankind first encountered extraterrestrial life forms, birthing a new era of understanding and collaboration. I will provide a detailed account of the evolution of this mindset, tracing back to the early days when humanity was still grappling with interstellar navigation and resource management. The exploration of space was often met with skepticism and fear, given its inherent risks and challenges, but through rational and strategic approaches, humans learned to appreciate the profound joys and rewards it brought. Over time, the notion of pleasure and pain shifted dramatically as people recognized that the pursuit of knowledge and unity in the cosmos was both fulfilling and formidable.\n\n2.
