Here is the text: One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

            "Two friends from the small village of Kasai embarked on a hunting trip by the river one evening. The weather shifted unexpectedly, turning foggy and calm. Suddenly, they heard distant war cries, causing them to worry that an enemy war party was approaching. They quickly hid behind a log, watching as several canoes approached. One canoe came close, carrying five men who invited them to join in a raid upriver. One hunter declined, concerned for his safety and the well-being of his family, but the other chose to go along.\n\nThe war party proceeded up the river and attacked a distant village. During the battle, one warrior announced that their new companion had been injured. Upon hearing this, the young man realized that he was among ghosts and feared for his life. He did not feel sick, but the warriors claimed that he had been shot.\n\nThey paddled back to Kasai before dawn, and the young man returned home, starting a fire and recounting the night's events. He explained how he fought alongside the ghostly warriors, witnessing numerous deaths on both sides. People were shocked to learn that he had accompanied ghosts on a battle. As the sun rose, the young man collapsed, black liquid seeped from his mouth, and he passed away, leaving the village in grief and fear."

            "In the quaint hamlet of Llanidan, two companions decided to venture into the woods for a hunting expedition at dusk. The weather took a surprising turn, wrapping the area in a dense fog and stillness. The tranquility was broken by distant, ominous cries that filled the hunters with dread, suspecting an imminent attack from a hostile tribe.\n\nScrambling for cover, they hid behind a large tree trunk, watching in disbelief as a flotilla of canoes approached. A particular canoe moved nearer, carrying five figures who, to their shock, invited them to partake in a raid upstream. One hunter declined, fearing for his own safety and that of his loved ones, but the other, driven by curiosity and bravado, agreed to the proposition.\n\nThe battle party progressed up the river, launching a surprise attack on a distant settlement. During the chaos, one warrior revealed that their new companion had been injured. Panic coursed through the young man as he realized he was surrounded by spectral beings. He feared for his very existence, though no physical pain was present, as the ethereal warriors claimed a poisoned arrow had struck him.\n\nThey paddled back to Llanidan prior to dawn. Entering his home and starting a fire, the young man recounted the night's harrowing events. Stunned silence fell upon those present as he described willingly joining forces with ghostly warriors and bearing witness to numerous casualties on both sides.\n\nAs the sun illuminated the morning sky, the young man succumbed to his mysterious ailment, blood-red liquid oozing from his mouth. Horror gripped the hamlet as they mourned the loss of their friend, now forever changed in their minds as one who had accompanied ghosts in war."

            "In the small, secluded village of Meadowgrove, two friends set out for a fishing trip along the river at dawn. The weather took an unexpected turn, enveloping the vicinity in a thick fog and stillness. The calm was disturbed by eerie, distant calls that made the fishermen uneasy, fearing an imminent attack from a menacing pack of wolves.\n\nHastily seeking shelter, they hid behind a large boulder, watching in shock as a group of canoes came into view. A specific canoe carrying five figures paddled nearer, inviting them to join a hunt upstream. Cautious but curious, one fisherman agreed, while the other declined, worried for their safety and those they loved.\n\nThe hunting party ventured up the river, ambushing a distant encampment. Overwhelmed by fear, the new companion discovered one of their own had been wounded during the chaos. Panic coursed through him as he realized he was surrounded by ethereal beings. He feared for his very existence, though no physical pain was present, as the ghostly hunters claimed a poisoned arrow had struck their companion.\n\nThey paddled back to Meadowgrove before sunrise. Upon entering his home, the fisherman started a fire and recounted the night's frightening ordeal. Shock and silence fell upon those listening as he spoke of willingly joining forces with spectral hunters and witnessing casualties on both sides.\n\nAs sunlight filled the morning sky, the impact of the mysterious ailment took hold of the injured fisherman, who began to foam green at the mouth. A chilling dread took over the village as they grieved the loss of their friend, forever changed in their minds as someone who had accompanied specters on a deadly hunt."

            "In the quiet, isolated hamlet of Greenshade, two neighbors embarked on a routine berry-picking expedition in the woods at daybreak. The peaceful atmosphere was disrupted by strange, far-off echoes that made the gatherers feel wary, suspecting some sinister force was lurking, ready to pounce.\n\nAs storm clouds gathered and visibility dwindled, they sought refuge behind a large oak tree. From their hiding place, they witnessed an unusual sight - a procession of horse-drawn carriages emerging from the mist, carrying mysterious figures. One of the gatherers impulsively accepted their invitation to join an unusual gathering in the heart of the forest, while the other decided to wait behind, anxious for their safety and their town's wellbeing.\n\nThe party proceeded deeper into the woods, ultimately stumbling upon a hidden gathering of supernatural beings. A feeling of dread washed over the newcomer as events unfurled, realizing too late that he had entered a realm where humans were outnumbered and the line between life and death was blurred.\n\nAs panic set in, he discovered that a fellow attendee had been struck by a mysterious, enchanted arrow, causing the stranger to fall unconscious. Overcome with fear for his existence and the future of his village, he pondered the consequences of his hasty decision.\n\nBy sunrise, they returned to Greenshade, where the adventurous gatherer detailed the previous night's chilling events. Hushed whispers filled the air as his fellow villagers tried to process the idea of humans fraternizing with mystical beings and bearing witness to lives abruptly cut short.\n\nDuring the following days, the impact of the mysterious affliction became apparent, taking hold of the stricken partygoer. Friends and family looked on in disbelief as he lapsed into an unnatural slumber, eventually awakening with a ghastly pallor. The quiet town of Greenshade was left to grapple with their forever-altered perception of their once jovial neighbor, now regarded as someone who had ventured too near to the shadowy world of the enigmatic and unnatural.\u201d"
