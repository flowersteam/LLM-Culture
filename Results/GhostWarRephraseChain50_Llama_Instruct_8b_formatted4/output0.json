Here is the text: One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

            "One dark and quiet night, two young men from Egulac ventured to the river to hunt seals, but as they arrived, the atmosphere became eerie and shrouded in fog. Suddenly, they heard loud war cries, and thinking it was a war party, they quickly escaped to the shore, hiding behind a thick log. As they cowered in fear, they noticed a canoe approaching, carrying five men who asked to take them along to launch an attack on the inhabitants. One of the young men hesitated, citing the absence of arrows, but was reassured by the warriors, who pointed out that there were arrows in the canoe. He declined, fearing his relatives would worry about his whereabouts, and asked his companion to join the warriors instead. His friend departed with the group, while the reluctant one returned home. The warriors went on to attack a neighboring town, where a violent battle ensued and many lives were lost. As the fight subsided, one of the warriors called out, \"Quick, let's retreat - that man has been hit!\" The hesitant young man reasoned that the warriors must be ghosts, as they claimed he had been shot, yet he appeared unhurt. The group retreated to Egulac, and the young man began to tell the tale of his extraordinary adventure, describing the horrific battle and the terrible toll it took. He proudly claimed that not only had he accompanied the 'ghostly' warriors, but also that he had fought alongside them, with many of their comrades falling, as well as those from the opposing side. He concluded his story, then suddenly fell silent. When the sun rose, he slumped to the ground, and a dark substance emerged from his mouth, accompanied by a grotesque contortion of his face. The onlookers gasped in horror as he eventually succumbed to death."
