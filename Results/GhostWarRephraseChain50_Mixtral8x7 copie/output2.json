Here is the text: One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

Suddenly, the weather took a turn, resulting in fog and silence. Fearing an approaching war party, they concealed themselves behind a log on the shore. As canoes approached, the sound of paddle strokes grew louder, and they observed a canoe with five men heading directly towards them. These men intended to initiate a war upstream against the local inhabitants. One of the young men declared, \"I don't have any arrows.\" They responded, \"The arrows are in the canoe.\" He declined, \"I won't go with you. I might get killed. My family is unaware of my whereabouts.\" Pointing to the other, he suggested, \"But you can join them.\" Consequently, one of the young men decided to join them, while the other chose to return home. The warriors proceeded upstream to a settlement on the opposite side of Kalama. A confrontation with the locals occurred, resulting in numerous injuries and fatalities. One warrior announced, \"Let's return home swiftly: that Indian has been struck.\" Upon hearing this, the young man deduced, \"They must possess supernatural abilities.\" Despite not experiencing any discomfort, they insisted he was injured. Upon their return, the young man disembarked from the boat, entered his home, and ignited a fire. He recounted his experience, stating, \"I accompanied the supernatural beings and we engaged in battle. Many of our allies were killed, and many of those we faced also perished. They claimed I was injured, but I didn't feel unwell.\" He shared the entire tale, then fell silent. As the first light of dawn appeared, he expired. A dark fluid emerged from his mouth, and his countenance altered. The people screamed and panicked. He was deceased. ##TEXTEND##"
