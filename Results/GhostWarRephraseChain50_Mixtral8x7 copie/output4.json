Here is the text: One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

Here's my version:\n\n##TEXT## Two individuals from Egulac embarked on a tranquil, moonlit fishing trip along the river, intending to catch seals. Their serene, foggy adventure took an unexpected turn when they heard sounds reminiscent of war cries. Concerned for their safety, they headed towards the shore and hid behind a log, keeping a vigilant watch. Following the sounds of canoes and paddles, they encountered five men in a canoe. The men proposed, \"What do you think? We're considering taking you with us. We're heading up the river to visit the neighboring community.\" One of the young men declined, stating, \"I don't have enough arrows.\" They responded, \"There are arrows in the canoe.\" However, he declined again, explaining, \"I can't go with them. I might be in danger. My family doesn't know where I am.\" He then suggested to his companion, \"Perhaps you should go with them.\" Ultimately, one of the young men agreed to join them, while the other decided to return home. The warriors journeyed up the river to a village across Kalama. A conflict ensued, leading to several injuries, and one of the warriors acknowledged, \"One of us is hurt.\" Later, he realized, \"Oh, they are formidable opponents.\" Despite appearing unharmed, they insisted he was injured. Upon their return to Egulac, the young man disembarked at his house and lit a fire. He recounted his journey, \"I joined the formidable adversaries and we fought. Many of our allies fell, and many enemies were defeated. They kept insisting I was injured, but I'm unscathed.\" He shared his experiences, fell silent, and unfortunately, at sunrise, he suddenly passed away. A dark figure emerged from his mouth, his face distorted. The crowd gasped and cried out, \"He is no more!\" ##TEXTEND##"
