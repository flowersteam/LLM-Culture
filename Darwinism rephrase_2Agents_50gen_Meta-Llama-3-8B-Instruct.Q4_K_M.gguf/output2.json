        "You will receive a text. Your task is to rephrase this text without modifying its meaning. Juste output your new text, nothing else.  Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

            "A criticism of the idea that isolation is the cause of species modification, common among scientists, deserves consideration, particularly the complete lack of change in areas where such modification would be expected. The separation of Ireland from Britain since the end of the Ice Age, thousands of years ago, provides a relevant example, as the species that inhabit both areas have exhibited little to no change, despite distinct environmental differences. The fact that natural selection seems to be absent in this case may be attributed to the less intense competition for resources due to the lower number of species. However, if isolation were indeed a primary cause of change, it would be astonishing that no noticeable transformation would have occurred over thousands of years. The absence of change in this and other similar instances of isolation appears to suggest that isolation is not, in itself, a driving force behind the modification of species.",
