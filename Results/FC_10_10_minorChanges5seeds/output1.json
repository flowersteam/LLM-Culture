            "Oscar had always shivered every time he saw the enormous oak tree towering at the end of his street. The tree was as old as his grandparents and had seen generation upon generation of his family living nearby. It was a part of the local folklore, and everyone believed it held a mysterious secret that had never been discovered.\n\nOne sunny morning, Oscar, an inquisitive 12-year-old, decided to climb that ancient oak. No ladders, no ropes, just the raw determination to uncover the supposed secret of the oak. Oscar was always up for a challenge, and climbing the gigantic oak seemed like the perfect quest to conquer.\n\nAs he ascended, he heard whispers in the wind that seemed to beckon him into the tree's core. Oscar found himself at a tangled knot of branches, mere inches from the oak's heart. There, at the apex, he stumbled upon a shallow cave with radiant sunlight streaming through its entrance, shining upon an ancient book. The book itself was covered in woodsy moves symbolizing the tree, turtles symbolizing long life and mysterious words that seemed to be written in the tree's very roots. \n\nOscar cautiously took the book in his hands, and his heart leapt as it opened to a chapter about his family's history and their bond with the oak. There were illustrations depicting the many celebrations and significant events that this oak tree had witnessed. Tedious maps and indications of hidden treasure were also scattered throughout the book, as well as drawing pronouncing the importance of looking after the tree and its connection with the family lore.\n\nFrom that moment on, Oscar became the guardian of his oak, riding out fierce storms, and nurturing its growth. He honored the legacy of his ancestors and the beautiful bond they had forged with the venerable oak tree.

He couldn't imagine what magic and adventure awaited him there.\n\nOne day, a traveling merchant named Grig arrived in the village, carrying an assortment of strange and wonderful trinkets. Tim managed to snag a small map from the merchants' cart. It was a weathered, tattered thing, cracked with age and stained with ink that seemed to mark specific spots throughout the woods.
