And what can we do to save our kingdom?\"\n\nThe wise grandmother replied, \"The calamity has been caused by nature's imbalance. We have vexed mother earth by overexploiting her resources. Our subjects, in their pursuit of materialistic happiness, have been treating earth like a bottomless pot full of treasures. The imbalance in nature has made mother earth very upset. Unless this changes, our kingdom will continue to suffer.\"\n\nThe queen realized the gravity of the problem. She immediately called her knights to gather and shared grandmother's wisdom.

His name was Revelo- and he claimed to have been digging in the mines for centuries.\n\nWhile they wandered through the depths of the mine, Philip noticed that the gems were shining more vibrantly than ever before.

Lily loved the natural beauty around her, marveling at the trees and the birds that sang in the massive oak trees.\n\nOne bright sunny day, as Lily was playing with her friends near the friendly river, they came upon a washed-up, glistening seashell.

With a hint of mischief, the villagers said the seashell was no ordinary thing, that it possessed a special power.\n\nBut try as she might, no one could quite figure out what that power was held. In her quiet moments, Lily would run her fingers along the pearly surface and imagine what adventures she could embark upon if only the secret was known.\n\nThis continued for a few moons - each day, Lily cast her hopes on the unembellished seashell and plotted about her escape to a distant land. It was the cusp of eve when she finally slipped from her home, her head filled with dreams of distant lands and all that awaited beyond the village boundary.\n\nWhen she reached a stretch of forest path that bordered uncertain terrain, she hesitantly approached and whispered, \"Seashell, please show me the path to your treasure.\" She held the shell over her ear and shook it gently.
