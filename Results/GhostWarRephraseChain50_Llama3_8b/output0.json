Here is the text: One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

You need to take some action and stop thinking about it.\" According to them, you should already use your innate intuition. You will still find it difficult to implement but will have an easier time with that in the future. You are addicted to failures and that addiction needs to go away so that your life can be normal again. You have to dig into the past and you might find some things that could help you with this problem. Don't worry about what others think about the truth. Rather than asking others to help you, make a decision for yourself. The thing that they can't tell you is the thing that you need. If you're not getting any feedback, then it's your job to start asking. If you're not getting any feedback, then it's your job to become a helper. You're in a way a helper. If you do this, you'll find that everything is accounted for and will no longer hold you back. This is not something new for you to get stuck into a state of numbness. It's something that will happen naturally. Put effort into understanding the situation. If you don't\u2014to tell someone who actually has the answer--you'll be stuck like a bad dream and unable to think clearly. start taking action and you'll no longer be a victim of your own mind.

If you keep your world by a journal, you will be more likely to improve it. positive thinking will get the problem out of your mind. The memories of the past are filled with the present moment and the event. People are preoccupied with the future with their lives and can't see that it happened in the past. You are trying to move closer to what you want and away from what you don't want. You need to think clearly. It's your task as a human to create the illusion that you have mastery over the conditions you're creation. It's best to encourage your partner to be more open-minded about the situation. Don't seek conflict, accept it with grace. Use your wisdom in tough time. Do you think it is possible to reword that for an AI?\"\n\"You need to stop waiting for \"what else\" and \"what next\".

I'd rephrase it as \"unable to 100% complete something, there's likely an issue with implementation.\"] That is touching the subject of correlations--it means, in probability theory, that \"correlation does not imply causation\". From the perspective of Wikipedia, this principle is also known in other disciplines, like biology, sociology, and physics. The principle states that if there is an observed statistical correlation between two variables, it does not necessarily mean there is a direct causal relationship between them. This means that the two variables are not related in any way. In other words, the two variables must be independent. In this case, you could say that you agree with their opinion and rephrase the text to make it more precise and accurate.\n"
