Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

            "The argument that physical separation, or isolation, is a driving force behind the evolution of species has a notable exception that warrants examination. In the case of Ireland, which has been geographically isolated from Britain since the end of the last Ice Age, we find a remarkable lack of change in its native fauna, including mammals, reptiles, and land snails. Despite the distinct differences in environment, both organic and inorganic, between the two lands, the Irish species have remained largely unaltered.\n\nThe absence of significant modification could be attributed to the reduced competition for resources, leading to a less intense struggle for survival. However, if isolation were indeed a primary and cumulative cause of speciation, one would expect to observe some changes in these isolated populations over the course of many thousands of years. The fact that no such alterations have been observed in this and numerous other instances of isolation suggests that it may not be an independent cause of evolutionary change."

Physically isolated from nearby landmasses for millions of years, its endemic flora and fauna have shown minimal divergence. The hypothesis that the absence of competition would result in less pressure to adapt appears plausible; however, the vast timespan would presumably provide ample opportunity for changes to accumulate.

The apparent lack of competition may account for the decreased incentive to adapt, yet the extensive timescale should have allowed for considerable evolutionary changes.
