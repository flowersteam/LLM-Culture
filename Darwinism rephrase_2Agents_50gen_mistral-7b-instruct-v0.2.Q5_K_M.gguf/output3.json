Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

Nevertheless, none of its mammals, reptiles, or terrestrial molluscs have experienced any discernible alterations, in spite of discernible differences in the environmental circumstances, both inorganic and organic. If natural selection is not the explanation for these changes, it might be attributed to the less burdensome competition resulting from a reduced number of rival species.

Despite this, there is no evidence of even the slightest modification among its mammals, reptiles, or land mollusks, in spite of discernible variations in both the inorganic and organic environments.

Ireland, which has been self-governing for roughly ten thousand years during the glacial period, is a relevant example. Despite significant ecological contrasts, no significant morphological modifications have been identified in its mammals, reptiles, or land snails. A reasonable explanation for the decelerated evolutionary progression through natural selection could be the diminished competition among species. However, it's important to recall that minor morphological adjustments have occurred even within prolonged isolation. The barely discernible morphological distinctions observable in Ireland and similar isolated ecosystems undermine the belief that isolation is the sole instigator for species adaptations.",
            "The dispute over the extent of species transformations brought about by extended isolation is problematic, given contradictory findings. Ireland, which has been self-governing for roughly ten thousand years throughout the glacial period, offers a compelling example. Notwithstanding sizable ecological variations, no substantial morphological changes have been identified in its wildlife, such as mammals, reptiles, and land snails. A potential explanation for the decreased evolutionary process via natural selection might be the diminishing rivalry among species. However, it's essential to acknowledge that insignificant morphological adjustments have emerged even within prolonged isolation. The inconspicuous morphological adjustments observable in Ireland and analogous enclosed ecosystems cast doubt on the notion that isolation is the sole catalyst for species adaptation."
