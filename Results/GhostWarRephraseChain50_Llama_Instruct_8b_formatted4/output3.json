Here is the text: One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

As they navigated through the mist, they were startled by war cries and decided to hide behind a log. Soon, canoes appeared, and the warriors, soon to be revealed as ghostly, offered to take them along to make war on the people living on the other side of Kalama. One of the young men declined, realizing he had no arrows and fearing he might be killed without his relatives knowing his whereabouts. However, he suggested his companion join the warriors, and one of them did so. The canoe party continued up the river, engaging in battle with the people, resulting in many casualties. Amidst the chaos, the young man thought to himself, \"These must be ghosts,\" as he didn't feel any pain despite being told he was struck. Eventually, the canoes returned to Egulac, and the young man recounted the eerie events, claiming to have fought alongside the paranormal warriors and witnessed many deaths. Unbeknownst to him, the spectral warriors had actually inflicted the mortal wound, which would soon take his life."

            "Two inexperienced hunters from Egulac went on a seal-hunting expedition, but after the fog lifted, they were startled by eerie cries of an unknown origin. Seeking shelter under a fallen tree, they accidentally met fervent warriors emerging from mysterious canoes. One hunter was reluctant to join Kalama's tribe, fearing for his family's safety if he were to be killed in combat. He implored his companion to comply with the warriors' requests, and one of them agreed. As they paddled upstream, their involvement in the conflict left a trail of devastation. Amidst the chaos, the young hunter rationalized that the warriors must have been battle-seasoned veterans; despite his wounds, he felt no panic. The warriors eventually returned to Egulac, and the young man, oblivious to the irony, narrated an extraordinary story, having suffered a mortal wound at the hands of his former allies."
