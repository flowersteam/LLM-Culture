Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

            "The argument presented by those opposing the belief that isolation brings about species modification raises some compelling questions. One such challenge is the observation of no apparent changes in the fauna of countries that have been geographically isolated for extensive periods. Cuba, for example, has been separate from other lands for over 100,000 years, providing an ideal opportunity for isolation to provoke evolutionary shifts. Nevertheless, its distinct fauna displays mere variations, not transformative alterations.\n\nThis lack of change, particularly in Cuba and other similarly isolated locations, casts doubt upon the theory that isolation itself is a driving force for species modification. The absence of significant evolutionary adaptations, despite the apparent opportunities for isolation to act, reinforces this notion.",
            "In the realm of biological evolution, an intriguing debate unfolds, as some scholars, such as Mr. Gulick, propose that isolation drives species transformation. Yet, a compelling counterargument warrants our consideration. At the heart of this argument lies the striking absence of evolutionary shifts in certain isolated environments, where one would expect to observe distinct changes.\n\nIreland presents a compelling testament to this conundrum. Having been isolated from Britain since the conclusion of the glacial epoch, believed to span over numerous millennia, this distinction in geography has yielded few noticeable alterations amongst the mammals, reptiles, and land molluscs. Despite the evident environmental disparities between the two territories, not a single marked shift has been identified.\n\nThis raises a significant question: if isolation is an effective catalyst for the modification of species, as Mr. Gulick suggests, why have no noticeable changes emerged in Irish fauna despite this extended isolation?\n\nMany propose that the struggle for existence in Ireland may be less daunting, attributed to the smaller quantity of competing species. However, if isolation is indeed the primary instigator, it is inexplicable that no substantial evolutionary advancements have taken place in thousands of years.\n\nLack of transformative changes observed in Ireland, and countless other similar instances of isolation, appear to cast doubt on the assertion that isolation is an inherent cause of evolutionary modification.",
            "In the debate surrounding the role of isolation as a catalyst for species transformation, an argument against Mr. Gulick's perspective merits consideration. Namely, the striking absence of evolutionary shifts in isolate populations deserving of our attention. Eva's Island, an intriguing example, presents itself as an ideal candidate for this discussion. Secluded from the mainland for an estimated tens of thousands of years, it is a testament to the ongoing dichotomy between proponents of the isolation theory and its detractors.\n\nDespite its geographical isolation from the rest of the world, no discernible modifications have transpired for a significant portion of Eva's terrestrial vertebrates, reptiles, and land mollusks. The environment on this island yields marked differences, both inorganic and organic, from the mainland, and yet the members of these isolated species remain unmoved.\n\nThe inconclusive evidence supporting the notion that these changes have not resulted from natural selection may lie in the less ferocious competition for resources, given the limited variety of species present. However, if isolation itself were a potent factor, continuously acting and cumulatively shaping these populations, the emergence of noticeable adaptations would seem a logical consequence. The dearth of observable changes throughout Eva's history raises some doubt regarding the decisiveness of this crucial factor.\n\nThe consistent absence of evolutionary milestones in Eva's inhabitants has been observed not only on this island but also in numerous other instances of isolation. This perplexing phenomenon offers compelling proof that isolation, devoid of other significant influences, may not, in fact, be an indispensable agent in the modification of species.",
            "In the realm of biological theory, the proposition put forth by figures such as Mr. Gulick, maintaining that separation leads to species adaptation, has met contention. A persuasive counterpoint merits consideration: the striking lack of transformation in entities that, given the theory's premise, should have undergone significant shifts.\n\nObserve the island of New Zealand, set apart from Australia for an estimated 80 million years. Despite this extensive isolation, not a single endemic mammal, reptile, or terrestrial mollusk has experienced even the most minuscule alteration. This stationary state is confounding, especially when considering the stark contrasts in environments - both physical and biological - separating these once-connected lands.\n\nIs it not peculiar, then, that no evidence of evolutionary change has emerged from New Zealand's distinct and unyielding isolation? Proponents of natural selection may argue that fewer competing species result in a diminished struggle for existence, precluding the necessity for change. However, if isolation inherently drives evolution, as some postulate, the absence of any discernible shift in countless generations is inexplicable.\n\nThis begs the question: If isolation fails to bring about change in New Zealand's ecosystem, are we to assume it holds no causative role in shaping species? The seemingly stable population dynamics of this and other geographically isolated territories might suggest otherwise.",
            "In the lush landscapes of New Zealand, a natural experiment unfolds, providing a compelling counterargument to those who assert that isolation fuels species transformation, much like Mr. Gulick. For over 80 million years, this secluded island nation has been separated from the rest of the world, providing an unparalleled opportunity to observe the effects of seclusion on biodiversity.\n\nYet, strikingly, the fauna of New Zealand, comprising its mammals, reptiles, and land molluscs, reveals an intriguing absence of transformation. Despite the drastic difference in environments \u2013 both abiotic and biotic \u2013 between New Zealand and its ancestral homeland, there exists barely a trace of modification.\n\nOne potential explanation may lie in the lesser intensity of natural selection, attributed to the smaller number of competing species. However, if isolation held the power to induce change continuously and cumulatively, as its proponents claim, the lack of evolutionary development in New Zealand's species is perpetually perplexing.\n\nThe unyielding stasis observed in New Zealand, as well as in countless other instances of isolation, calls into question the role of isolation as a primary force shaping the natural world."

Consider the case of an island like Eva, supposedly isolated for tens of thousands of years. Against all expectations, Eva's terrestrial vertebrates, reptiles, and land mollusks have not shown any noteworthy adaptations, despite marked differences in their environments.\\\n\nThe paucity of evolutionary evidence in Eva's ecosystem has intrigued scholars.
