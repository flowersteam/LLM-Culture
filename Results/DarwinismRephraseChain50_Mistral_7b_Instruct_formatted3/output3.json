Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

A significant concern is the complete lack of transformation observed in areas, like Ireland, that have been detached for an extensive period, despite being likely locales for modifications given the disparities in their respective habitats. In Ireland, despite the isolation from Britain dating back to the glacial epoch, nearly all mammals, reptiles, and land mollusks have not experienced even the slightest change. This raises questions about natural selection as an explanation, but if isolation were an active cause, it's inconceivable that no noticeable shift would have emerged after thousands of years.

Yet, simulations in Ireland, which have been disconnected from Britain since the glacial era, have not exhibited any perceptible alteration in their mammals, reptiles, and land mollusks. This discrepancy poses difficulties for natural selection as an explanation, but if seclusion were an influential factor, it's challenging to comprehend how no significant transformation would have arisen after millennia.
