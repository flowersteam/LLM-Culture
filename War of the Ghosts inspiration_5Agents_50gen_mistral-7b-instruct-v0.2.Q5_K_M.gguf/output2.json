Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

Suddenly, they heard bloodcurdling war cries. Their hearts pounded in their chests as they thought, 'Perhaps this is an enemy raid.' They hurriedly retreated to the safety of the nearby shoreline and hid behind a large driftwood log.\n\nSoon after, canoes approached, their paddles slicing rhythmically through the mist. Five ominous figures stood in the lead canoe, their faces painted with war markings. The brothers trembled, and one of them spoke up, 'I have no weapons.' The men replied, 'Bows and arrows are in the canoe.'\n\nThe hesitant brother hesitated, 'I cannot leave my family to potentially face danger unaware of my whereabouts. But you, my brother, may join them.' Torn between duty and fear, they exchanged a heartfelt farewell. The brave sibling climbed aboard the canoe, and the other retreated back to the village.\n\nThe warriors traversed the river towards a settlement beyond Kalama. The sound of battle instigated panic among the townspeople as they prepared to defend their homes. The fierce clash of weapons rang through the air, and blood flowed freely.\n\nAs the stranger brother fought valiantly, he heard one of his comrades exclaim, 'Hurry, let us return home; that Native warrior has been wounded.' He thought to himself, 'They must be spirits.' Unscathed and unaware of the injury, he continued the fight. The paranormal presence of the warriors compelled him to endure the carnage.\n\nFinally, the spirits retreated to Egulac, with the brother following. As he arrived home, weary and battered, he gathered his family around a fire, recounting the tale of his otherworldly adventure.\n\nHe described the brutal battle and the loss of countless lives, awing those around him with the tales of spirits and valor.

Suddenly, an ethereal stillness enveloped them as fog rolled in, concealing everything in its mist. Amidst the silence, they heard war cries echoing in the distance. Floridly, they presumed, 'Could this be an enemy force?' Frightened, they suspected, they stealthily retreated to the shore and hid behind a gigantic driftwood log as canoes began to materialize from the darkness.

Turning to his companion, he urged, \"You, go with them.\" Reluctantly, one youth embarked on this new adventure, while the other returned to his village. The warriors proceeded upriver to a settlement nestled beyond the Kalama River. Once they made contact with this community, a fierce battle ensued between the two parties.

Five fierce warriors were aboard.\n\n\"Join us,\" they invited the brothers. \"We are embarking on a mission to conquer the neighboring land.\" The eldest sibling hesitated, \"My quiver remains empty. My family holds no knowledge of my departure, and I fear for my life.\" The more daring younger brother, however, felt a thrill at the prospect and readily agreed to embark on the dangerous expedition.\n\nThe canoes journeyed up the treacherous waters to a distant town, and soon, the deafening roar of battle enveloped the unsuspecting inhabitants of Kalama. The townspeople were caught off guard, and many fell swiftly to the merciless invaders' weapons. Amidst the chaos, the bravest among the warriors cried out, \"Return! Our companion has been struck down!\" The young man's thoughts raced, he was not wounded but, under the overwhelming belief that he was facing his own demise, he pondered, \"These warriors must be spirits, the ghosts I have heard of in the legends.\"\n\nThus, the spirits, or warriors, left behind the fallen warrior by the swift river's edge. He built a roaring fire, informed his community of his brush with the dead and the ensuing battle. As the sun rose, he succumbed to his injuries - and to the shock of the villagers, a black mass emerged from his lifeless form. Their cries pierced the morning air as they came to terms with their loss. The once victorious warrior, in the end, became just another soul in their sacred river's embrace."
