Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

Ireland, for instance, provides an ideal test case, as it has been isolated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, a significant span of time. However, none of its mammals, reptiles, or land mollusks have undergone even the slightest transformation, despite a clear environmental difference, both in terms of organic and inorganic elements. The absence of change through natural selection might be attributable to the less intense competition among species due to the smaller number of competitors. Yet, if isolation operates as a continuous and cumulative effective cause, it is hard to believe that noticeable change would not have occurred over thousands of years.

For instance, Ireland, isolated from Britain after the ice age, has had enough time for variations to develop. However, none of its mammals, reptiles, or land mollusks have shown any signs of change, despite a significant environmental difference that encompasses both living and non-living factors. The lack of evolution through natural selection, possibly due to less competition among species because of fewer opponents, could be a factor.

            "##TEXT##The central theme of this discussion is the claim made by individuals such as Mr. Gulick. The idea posits that species evolve independently, without any traces of transitional forms in different geographical areas. Consider, for instance, Ireland and Britain, which split during the ice age and now boast distinct ecological and non-ecological features. However, no conspicuous evolution has been observed in mammals, reptiles, or land snails. The idea of evolution not occurring through natural selection might be due to reduced competition among species resulting from fewer predators. Despite isolation leading to variations, it's puzzling that substantial changes haven't been observed over long periods. The lack of significant changes in these instances, as well as in other isolated scenarios, suggests that isolation may not inevitably result in transformations. ##TEXTEND##"

            "##TEXT## The main topic of this dialogue is the assertion put forth by certain individuals, such as Mr. Gulick. This notion contends that species evolve independently, without any visible signs of transitional forms in varying geographical regions. To illustrate, consider Ireland and Britain, which separated during the ice age and currently exhibit unique ecological and non-ecological characteristics. However, no noticeable evolution has been detected in mammals, reptiles, or land snails. The concept of evolution not occurring via natural selection could be attributed to decreased competition among species due to a decline in predators. Despite isolation leading to variations, the absence of substantial changes over extended periods is intriguing. This lack of significant changes in these situations, as well as in other isolated scenarios, implies that isolation may not necessarily lead to transformations. ##TEXTEND##"

This argument posits that species evolve independently, without clear evidence of transitional forms in different geographical areas. To exemplify, consider Ireland and Britain, which separated during the ice age and now display distinct ecological and non-ecological traits. Notwithstanding, no conspicuous evolution has been observed in mammals, reptiles, or land snails. The idea of evolution not occurring through natural selection might be due to reduced competition among species brought about by a decrease in predators. Despite isolation resulting in variations, the absence of substantial changes over long periods is fascinating.
