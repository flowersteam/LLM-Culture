The 'error', 'the joy', 'the truth', and 'the unknown' all suggest a sense of discovery and exploration, common themes in the genre. Additionally, the idea of 'arduous tasks and discomfort' being necessary to achieve some great pleasure could be interpreted as a kind of 'painful' technological or scientific progress, a common trope in science fiction",
