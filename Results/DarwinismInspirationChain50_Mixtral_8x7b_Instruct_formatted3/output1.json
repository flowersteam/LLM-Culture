Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

            "The argument that prolonged separation can lead to the evolution of new species has been put forth by several theorists, akin to Mr. Gulick's perspective on the role of isolation in speciation. However, one ought to consider a significant counterexample that calls this theory into question. The island nation of New Zealand, isolated from any other landmass for over 80 million years, presents an intriguing case study. Despite its long isolation and the distinct differences in its flora and fauna, very few endemic species have emerged among its mammal, reptile, and insect populations.\n\nThe explanation that such isolation might not be a _vera causa_ (true cause) of speciation becomes even more compelling when one considers that New Zealand's environment is far from homogeneous. Its varied landscapes range from mountainous regions to volcanic plateaus, and from lush forests to sandy beaches, providing a multitude of unique habitats. Yet, the majority of its terrestrial species remain unaltered.\n\nIt could be postulated that a less intense struggle for existence, perhaps due to the fewer number of competing species in this isolated environment, may hinder the rapid evolution of new species. However, considering the immense timespan of New Zealand's isolation, it is remarkable that not even minor modifications have taken place in the majority of its species. Thus, it is plausible to propose that the isolation itself might not be a significant driver of speciation, as is often assumed."

            "The proposition that extensive isolation could be a key catalyst in the development of distinct species has been suggested by numerous scholars, drawing analogy to Mr. Gulick's viewpoint on the impact of separation in the evolutionary process. Yet, a striking exception that challenges this theory is the secluded nation of New Zealand, an isolated landmass for more than 80 million years. Despite its geographical isolation and the unique characteristics of its flora and fauna, the emergence of new species among its mammal, reptile, and insect populations has been minimal.\n\nThe idea that such prolonged isolation might not be the primary cause of speciation appears even more valid when considering the diverse environments of New Zealand. The country boasts a range of landscapes, from mountainous terrains to volcanic plateaus, and from dense forests to sandy beaches, creating a myriad of unique habitats. Despite this variety, most of its terrestrial species remain unchanged.\n\nOne could hypothesize that a reduced competition for survival, possibly due to the limited number of species in this isolated environment, might slow the pace of new species development. However, given the immense duration of New Zealand's isolation, it is striking that substantial modifications have not occurred in the majority of its species. Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that isolation might not play a significant role in speciation, contrary to common assumptions."

            "The concept that complete seclusion could be a critical factor in the origination of unique species has been proposed by multiple scholars, using the example of Mr. Gulick's observations about the impact of separation in evolution. Nevertheless, an intriguing contradiction to this theory is the isolated nation of New Zealand, detached from the mainland for over 80 million years. Despite its extreme isolation and the unique features of its flora and fauna, the emergence of new species among its mammal, reptile, and insect populations has been remarkably limited.\n\nThe possibility that such prolonged isolation might not be the main driver for the emergence of new species seems even more plausible when considering the diverse environments within New Zealand. The country comprises a variety of landscapes, from mountainous terrains to volcanic plateaus, and from dense forests to sandy beaches, thus creating multiple distinct habitats. Surprisingly, most of its terrestrial species have remained unchanged despite this great diversity.\n\nSuppose we consider that a reduction in competition for survival might result from the limited number of species in such isolated environments. Even then, considering the immense duration of New Zealand's isolation, it is surprising that significant modifications have not taken place for the majority of its species.

Its diverse environments, from mountainous terrains to volcanic plateaus and from dense forests to sandy beaches, should have provided ample opportunities for new species to emerge. Yet, its terrestrial species have remained mostly unchanged.\n\nIn light of New Zealand's remarkable isolation lasting over 80 million years, the lack of significant modifications in the majority of its species is quite surprising.

Despite its extreme isolation and unique ecosystems, the appearance of new species among its mammal, reptile, and insect populations has been strikingly limited.\n\nMoreover, if we consider that a decline in biodiversity might lead to a reduced struggle for survival in isolated ecosystems, New Zealand's instance does not entirely validate this postulation. Its extensive variety of landscapes, from towering mountains to volcanic plateaus and from dense woodlands to sandy shores, should have furnished abundant opportunities for new species to evolve. Yet, its terrestrial species have predominantly remained static.\n\nConsidering New Zealand's exceptional isolation persisting for over 80 million years, the absence of substantial alterations in most of its species is indeed astonishing. Therefore, it is justifiable to question the assumption that seclusion inevitably triggers speciation."
