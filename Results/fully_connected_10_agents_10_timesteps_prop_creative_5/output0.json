For her, this was the only place where the world made sense.\n\nOne summer evening, as Elara sat on the giant root of the oak tree, she was engulfed in the embrace of golden rays of the setting sun. She gazed at the streaks of vibrant colors painting the sky above, and her heart swelled with a renewed sense of wonder.\n\nLost in her thoughts, she pondered upon why she felt such an inexplicable connection with the tree that stood tall like a silent sentinel. No one else seemed to share her fascination with it. She wondered if other children had felt this way too.\n\nSuddenly, a soft melody drifted from the heart of the tree. Enrapted by its haunting charm, Elara pondered how she could have missed it all these years.
