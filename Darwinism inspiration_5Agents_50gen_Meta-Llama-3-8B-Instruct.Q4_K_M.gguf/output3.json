Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

Yet, despite the diversity of which other species made this vast expanse their home, this majestic antelope remains a testament to stability, refusing to yield to the whims of genetic drift.",
            "As we gaze at the majestic Peaks of Alaska, a stark reminder of the power of geological forces, I couldn't help but ponder the opposite notion - that repetition itself can be a catalyst for transformation. Take the consistent melodies of Tibetan monk chanting, for instance, where the repetition of sacred syllables crafts a sonic tapestry that awakens the soul. If isolation can be ignored by the flux of time, perhaps the steady hum of repetition can shape the contours of our very existence.",

            "In the vast expanse of the Amazon rainforest, there exists a peculiar phenomenon that challenges the notion of species adaptation. A subspecies of the iconic blue-and-yellow macaw has thrived in complete isolation for centuries, with no discernible changes to its characteristics. This spurs the question: can one environment be so optimal that it renders isolation unnecessary, rendering the species' adaptation superfluous?",
            "The notion that a particular soil composition is apt to produce a specific type of flora, neglects to consider the vast array of similar environments where the same species thrive. For instance, the identical soil found in several regions has yielded distinct ecosystems, defying the notion that a single factor alone determines the diversity of plant life. This raises intriguing questions about the interplay of multiple variables in shaping our natural world."
