Here is the text: One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals and while they were there it became foggy and calm. Then they heard war-cries, and they thought: 'Maybe this is a war-party'. They escaped to the shore, and hid behind a log. Now canoes came up, and they heard the noise of paddles, and saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe, and they said: 'What do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people.' One of the young men said,'I have no arrows.' 'Arrows are in the canoe,' they said. 'I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone. But you,' he said, turning to the other, 'may go with them.' So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went on up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight, and many were killed. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, 'Quick, let us go home: that Indian has been hit.' Now he thought: 'Oh, they are ghosts.' He did not feel sick, but they said he had been shot. So the canoes went back to Egulac and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everybody and said: 'Behold I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed, and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit, and I did not feel sick.' He told it all, and then he became quiet. When the sun rose he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried.He was dead."

            "In the stillness of a moonlit night, two youths from the Egulac tribe ventured to the riverbank to hunt for seals. As they waiting, the tranquility was shattered by eerie war cries. Convinced that a raiding party was near, they swiftly retreated to the safety of the shore and concealed themselves behind a large driftwood log.\n\nSoon enough, canoes appeared, gliding peacefully along the water. Five mysterious figures emerged, beckoning the young men to join them. 'Where are your weapons?' they inquired, promising an invitation to their impending conquest.\n\nFearful, one youth replied, 'I carry no arrows.' The warriors, unperturbed, offered a solution. 'Borrow from us,' they encouraged. But relentless terror gripped the first youth, knowing that his absence might endanger his family. 'My relative', he declared, turning toward the other, 'may go with you.' With a heavy heart, he wished his companion a safe journey before returning to the village.\n\nThe warriors pressed onward up the river, their canoes weaving between fierce currents to engage in the bitter struggle at a settlement across from Kalama. The battle raged, witnessing both sides suffering losses.\n\nAmid the carnage, the young survivor heard one of the opponents falter, \"We must leave \u2013 that warrior has fallen!\" Startled, he realized in horror that they had indeed been facing real enemies. As his comrades paddled away, the weight of his escape heavy on his conscience, the young man managed to survive the ordeal.\n\nReturning to his tribe, he claimed the victory as if it were his own, standing before his surprised and awed people. He recounted detailed war stories \u2013 of fallen comrades on both sides \u2013 leaving them both in awe and silence.\n\nWhen dawn broke, the young survivor grew weary. His speech had ended, his tales told, and as his heart pounded with the unspoken truth, darkness claimed him. A strange substance dripped from his open mouth, his face contorted with a terrifying finality, leaving the onlookers no choice but to mourn their dear hero.",
            "Two nights ago, two brave youths from the village of Wahpeton ventured to the riverbank for an elusive seal hunt. The serenity of the night was disrupted by the stillness of the fog and the unexpected sound of war cries. Dread crept into their hearts as they supposed, 'Perhaps this is an enemy invasion.' They promptly sought refuge behind a gargantuan tree trunk along the shoreline.\n\nSwiftly emerging from the fog, canoes appeared, their occupants making their intentions clear, 'We aim to bring you aboard. We're off to wage war against the neighboring tribe.' When one young man courageously voiced his concern, 'I lack projectiles,' the warriors graciously supplied him, 'An abundance waits for you in our vessel.' However, the other youth hesitated and replied, 'I cannot join as my loved ones wouldn't know my whereabouts. But you,' he said, turning to his companion, 'may embark.' Hence, one man ventured forward, leaving his brother behind.\n\nThe warriors continued their journey up the river, inexorably approaching a settlement nestled on the far side of Tulalip. Unwavering, the people met them at the water's edge and engaged in fierce conflict, resulting in the loss of numerous lives on both sides. Yet, the young man, seemingly untouched, perceived his companions to be otherworldly beings.\n\nAlone, the warrior heard one comrade confirm, 'Hasten, let us depart: that man has been struck.' Now bewildered, he believed, 'Could these be spirits?' He did not lament his wound, but was puzzled by their claim. Upon returning to Egulac, the young man gathered his family and recounted the chilling tale, 'Behold, I journeyed with the spirits, wage war with them, and many casualties filled both sides.'\n\nAs the calming sun rose, the young man succumbed, blackness seeping from his lifeless mouth, his face contorted one last time. Stunned tears filled the air as the people realized, 'Our brother, he was not merely accompanying spirits; he had been killed.'",
            "Under the tranquil cover of night, two youths from Wakila ventured to the riverbank with the intention of sealing their fortune through the hunt. The serene atmosphere was soon disrupted by the eerie sound of battle cries, their minds racing with the possibility of an imminent raid. They swiftly concealed themselves behind a colossal driftwood, as a procession of canoes emerged from the mist. These vessels were manned by a formidable squad of ten warriors, who requested the hesitant youths to join them in their journey upriver.\n\nOne of the young men, named Kaipo, hesitated and expressed his concern for his safety and that of his family, who were unaware of his whereabouts. His companion, Kaimana, lacked such reservations. Kaimana agreed to accompany the warriors, leaving Kaipo behind.\n\nThe warriors proceeded to wage war on a village residing beyond the Kalama Riverbend. A fierce and deadly battle ensued, resulting in the loss of many lives from both sides. As the contest wore on, the victorious warriors grew weary and received word that one of their own had been mortally wounded.\n\nIn fear that they were dealing with otherworldly foes, Kaipo believed he had witnessed a supernatural encounter when he heard of his injured companion. He recounted the tale to his tribe, explaining how they had confronted spectral adversaries, resulting in numerous casualties for both camps.\n\nHowever, despite maintaining his composure and not experiencing any immediate physical pain, the episode took a disastrous turn as Kaipo succumbed to his wounds hours later. His body convulsed, emitting an unnerving substance from his mouth, and his face twisted in agony. The horrified villagers mourned for their fellow tribesman.",
            "Two brothers from the village of Wahpeton set out one evening to hunt beavers along the riverbank. The tranquil night soon turned eerie with the arrival of fog and an ominous stillness. As they huddled in fear, they heard alarming war cries. Believing a rival tribe had come to attack, they swiftly fled to the safety of the shore and hid behind a massive tree.\n\nSoon, canoes filled with five men appeared, and they coaxed the brothers to join them. 'Come, we wish to bring you with us as we march upriver to declare war on the nearby tribe.' One brother replied hesitantly, 'I have no weapons.' The warriors responded, 'We have ammunition aplenty in our canoes.' But the brother, worried for his family, refused. He appealed to his other brother, urging him to join the warriors.\n\nReluctantly, the other brother agreed, and the warriors left for their destination. A fight soon broke out at a village on the other side of the Kalama River, resulting in substantial casualties on both sides. However, one of the brothers survived the battle, only to realize later that his comrades were not men but spirits. Considering himself a veritable ghost, he returned to his village and recounted his harrowing tales. Despite seeming unscathed, his body betrayed him as dark ichor oozed from his mouth. Unable to accept the reality, his people wept in denial as their beloved brother died before their eyes.",
            "Two brothers from the village of Wakonda embarked on a moonlit journey to the riverbank, intending to hunt beavers. As they waited, the tranquility was disrupted by the appearance of a thick, eerie fog. With the stillness came the sound of war cries, causing them to suspect an impending attack. Racing to the shoreline, they concealed themselves behind a mammoth tree. Cautiously, canoes emerged from the mist carrying five determined warriors. Their intent was clear: they desired new recruits.\n\nOne brother hesitated, explaining he had forgotten his bow and arrows. The answer was simple: the weapons were contained within the canoe. Faced with the realization that he might never return, he reluctantly refused the offer. Turning to his brother, he pleaded, \"But you, go with them.\"\n\nWith a heavy heart, the younger brother ventured forth, while the elder remained behind. The warriors continued their journey, eventually reaching their destination: a village nestled along the banks of the Nebraska River. Upon arrival, a fierce battle ensued between the two clans. In the midst of the conflict, the younger brother heard a familiar cry: \"Quick, let us leave! That warrior has been struck down.\"\n\nSudden fear gripped him. Were these the spirits of his ancestors, returning to claim their revenge? He wasn't harmed, but the terrified warriors insisted he had been gravely injured. Unwilling to demure any longer, the ghostly figures returned to their homeland, bringing the injured brother with them.\n\nUpon their arrival, the shocked villagers built a fire. The brother recounted his harrowing adventure, proudly describing the outcome: \"Many of our people fell, but so did many from the other side.\" As he finished his tale, a deep quiet settled over the camp. The sun began to rise, and the brother, now pale and lifeless, stumbled towards the fire. A dark substance oozed from his lips, and his face contorted in agony. The villagers cried out as he succumbed to his wounds \u2013 the ghosts had deceived him, and death had come to claim the young warrior's spirit."
