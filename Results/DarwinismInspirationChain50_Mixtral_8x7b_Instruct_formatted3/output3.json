Here is the text: One objection to the views of those who, like Mr. Gulick, believe isolation itself to be a cause of modification of species deserves attention, namely, the entire absence of change where, if this were a _vera causa_, we should expect to find it. In Ireland we have an excellent test case, for we know that it has been separated from Britain since the end of the glacial epoch, certainly many thousand years. Yet hardly one of its mammals, reptiles, or land molluscs has undergone the slightest change, even although there is certainly a distinct difference in the environment both inorganic and organic. That changes have not occurred through natural selection, is perhaps due to the less severe struggle for existence owing to the smaller number of competing species; but, if isolation itself were an efficient cause, acting continuously and c.u.mulatively, it is incredible that a decided change should not have been produced in thousands of years. That no such change has occurred in this, and many other cases of isolation, seems to prove that it is not in itself a cause of modification."

            "The argument that physical separation can lead to biological differences in species, as proposed by proponents such as Mr. Gulick, has a notable exception that merits consideration. This exception lies in the total lack of modification found in instances where one would expect such changes to have occurred. Ireland, for instance, serves as a compelling example, having been isolated from Britain since the end of the last ice age. Despite the clearly distinct environmental differences, both in terms of its geology and the life forms that inhabit it, there has been a remarkable absence of modification in the majority of its mammals, reptiles, and land mollusks.\n\nThe idea that these species have remained unchanged due to a less intense struggle for survival, as a result of fewer competing species, is an interesting proposition. However, if isolation itself were a significant and cumulative cause of modification, as asserted, it is incredibly unlikely that we would not observe some level of change in these isolated populations over the course of thousands of years.\n\nThe fact that such changes have not manifested in this and many other cases of isolation suggests that there might be other factors at play that contribute to the modification of species, or that isolation itself may not be as influential a cause as some theorists suggest."

This exception manifests in the form of no genetic variation in locations where one would anticipate such developments. For instance, Iceland, which has been isolated from Europe since the end of the last ice age, serves as a striking example. Despite the obvious differences in its environment, such as the geological composition and the life forms that inhabit it, there is a noticeable absence of genetic diversity in the majority of its mammals, reptiles, and land invertebrates.\n\nOne plausible explanation is that the species have remained genetically unaltered due to a less intense evolutionary pressure, resulting from a reduced number of competing species. Nevertheless, if isolation itself were a substantial and compounding factor for genetic modification, as some researchers propose, it is highly improbable that we would not detect any genetic changes in these isolated populations over the course of thousands of years.\n\nThe reality that such alterations have not emerged in this instance, as well as in numerous other cases of isolation, suggests that there could be additional factors influencing the genetic modification of species. Alternatively, isolation might not be as significant a cause as some scientists suggest. Further investigation is needed to determine the complex interplay between these factors and to fully understand the mechanisms of evolution."

Yet, this notion encounters a formidable exception in regions characterized by a scarcity of genetic diversity where it would be expected to thrive. Iceland, an island severed from Europe since the last ice age, stands as a compelling illustration. Despite its unique geological formations and rich wildlife, a significant portion of its mammals, reptiles, and terrestrial invertebrates exhibit surprisingly low genetic diversity.\n\nA potential rationale could be the minimal number of species and reduced evolutionary pressures, which may have constrained genetic alterations. However, this theory doesn't adequately explain why such isolation hasn't fostered genetic modifications within these populations over thousands of years.\n\nThis absence of variation hints at the possibility of other influential factors impacting genetic modifications or questions the extent of isolation's role in shaping genetic diversity compared to earlier assumptions.

            "The idea that geographical isolation can result in unique biological features within a species is a well-accepted concept, as exemplified by Mr. Gulick's observations. Nevertheless, this theory encounters a substantial hurdle in regions with scarce genetic diversity, which one might expect to be a breeding ground for this phenomenon. A prime example is Iceland, an island severed from Europe since the last ice age, which strikingly lacks genetic diversity in numerous mammals, reptiles, and terrestrial invertebrates.\n\n A feasible rationale could be the small number of species and reduced evolutionary pressures. However, this alone does not sufficiently explain why such isolation has not initiated genetic variations in these populations over thousands of years. This paucity of diversity implies the presence of other potent factors influencing genetic modifications, or it could prompt a reevaluation of how significantly isolation impacts genetic diversity compared to our current understanding. Further studies are needed to untangle the intricate relationship between geographical isolation, genetic adaptations, and evolutionary forces."

However, this theory faces a challenge in regions with limited genetic diversity, such as New Zealand, which is home to a relatively small number of mammal, bird, and reptile species. Despite being isolated for millions of years, New Zealand has not developed a high level of genetic diversity within its species.\n\nOne possible explanation is the small population sizes and decreased evolutionary pressures. But this alone may not fully account for the lack of genetic variation in these populations over such a long period of time. This dearth of diversity suggests the presence of other significant factors influencing genetic modifications. Alternatively, it may be necessary to reevaluate the extent to which isolation truly impacts genetic diversity compared to the current understanding.

A intriguing illustration of this notion can be observed in the societies inhabiting the confined, barely traversed mountains of the Andes. The high altitude and severe climatic conditions of this region have led to the emergence of unique genetic attributes among these communities.\n\nThe genetic attributes have stemmed from a range of factors, including the size and consistency of these populations, intense evolutionary pressures from severe environmental conditions, and the necessity of adapting to extreme climatic variations. There might be undiscovered factors contributing to this remarkable genetic diversity.\n\nDelving deeper into the complex relationship between geographical isolation, genetic adaptations, and evolutionary patterns holds immense potential for broadening our understanding of human genetic diversity. The notable biodiversity found in the Andes and its isolated tribes provides a rich opportunity to investigate these intricate interactions and uncover new insights into the forces that mold genetic uniqueness in human populations.
